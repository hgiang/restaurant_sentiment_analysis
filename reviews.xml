	<review>I have been eating here for the last 10+ years. This is my first and well over due review. Many years ago I worked in SF and would frequent this fine restaurant at least once a month, now living as far away as we do it tends to be several times a year. For the last 8 years, I have been having my family holiday Christmas party here, special occasions, or just a nice night out with my wife.  I have NEVER once had a bad experience. This place is PRIME RIB only, hence the name. If that's not your thing, then I am sure you can find a good Sushi restaurant or a whole foods just down the road. But if you want the best piece of meat you will ever find, then come here.  Reservations are a must, we book Christmas for the following year, while we are enjoying the current holiday meal. They provide a true East Coast feel steak house, decor is dark woods, white table cloths, and the entire service staff is trained and professional. They have an amazing wine room that was a great remodel done years ago just behind the bar.  When you arrive at your table, your provided hot warm bread as you look over the select menu. Basically, you choose the cut of meat, your starch, and veg. My order and recommendation is House or King cut (Rare to Med Rare), Mashed potato, and creamed spinach. Ask for the Pink horseradish cream (old side only provided upon request now), and a nice glass of Pinot or Cab.  I have had prime rib all over the world, some of the finest restaurants and I have never had a similar flavor of meat anywhere. This place is great for intimate dinners, family gatherings, dinner meetings and holiday traditions. The service is top notch, the restaurant is always busy open to close, and its a true pleasure. We have so many good memories here, and look forward to countless more.  This is a true San Francisco experience, you must make this a stop if your visiting that fine city. A couple can expect to spend $120 depending on drinks or wine for a dinner for two, this includes the well deserved tip folks. Parking is not a issue, they have front door Valet that is $10 including the tip for the average vehicle. Enjoy friends, tis is a true special place.</review>

	<review>I came here for my 2 year anniversary with the gf. I made a reservation 6 months in advance just to make sure. We were pretty excited and hyped up about going here. When arriving, there was no parking around the area (what do you expect, its SF...) so I used the valet service. 9 bucks along with a few bucks of tip. Upon entering the restaurant, it was a different environment than what I expected. I thought it would be a quiet atmosphere because I thought it was a fancy place but it turned out to be super loud. Maybe because it was the night before St. Patricks Day. This doesn't matter that much to me but we got seated right away even when our reservation was at 6 and we arrived a little early. Our waiter was amazing and super nice although I couldn't hear what he was saying sometimes because he talked kind of softly in a loud environment so I just nodded and smiled. He explained the sizes of the different cuts and was super friendly. The food was amazing. It was beyond the hype so I was extremely satisfied. I usually don't like salad but the presentation of the salad spinning made the salad taste more delicious. The sides were great too. We got all of the sides except the mashed potatoes and everything paired with the prime rib went super well together. I got the King Henry cut and even with such a thick cut the meat was so tender and juicy its making me want to go back right away. Overall this is a great place for any occasion because of the environment and I would definitely come back again although it is a bit pricey if you visit too often.</review>

	<review>It has been awhile since I have had such exceptional service and the House of Prime Rib provided just that.  They weren't kidding when they said they wanted you to walk away completely satisfied.  I'm not sure I finished any of my food.  But it was all delicious.  Yum, yum, yum! My husband and I have been meaning to try this place for years and decided we better try it now before we move in a few months and are we ever glad we did!  We didn't have reservations and walked in about an hour after it opened hoping to get a table and we were probably seated within 45 minutes of arriving, which is what they had estimated.   The place has a good mix of fancy locals having dinner before a night out on the town and tourists, trust me you can tell, but they treat everyone equally.   Our waiter, Todd, was wonderful.  We never had to want for anything, he anticipated our every need.  The wait for our food? Mere minutes! Everything came out so quickly and he kept an eye on us to make sure we were ready for each course.  The food was amazing! I ordered the smallest cut, medium well and it was super juicy.  It may have been the smallest cut, but between the mixed nuts at the bar and the bread and salad starter, I was stuffed so I only made it through half my prime rib.  My husband ordered house cut medium rare.   He polished off his entire plate, prime rib, sides and all.  And that's all he could handle, even being the big eater that he is. We never had to ask for refills for our drinks, the check was out as soon as I asked and returned almost as soon as I handed him my card.   Todd was a great server and we definitely appreciated him making our evening as enjoyable as it was.   This place is definitely as good as it gets.</review>

	<review>You've never had prime rib before if you haven't tried House of Prime Rib. Not surprised that my first 5 stars review goes to my first time at House of Prime Rib. Even though the boyfriend made reservations, we still had to wait around 15 minutes to get seated, which was not bad considering we added two more people at the last minute, and it was Valentines Day. The decoration of the restaurant was nice and the service was friendly and attentive. The waiter gave a brief explanation of their menu in order to make sure we were satisfied with what we chose. I can not think of a word or phrase to describe that first bite. It was that good! I ordered the House Of Prime Rib cut, baked potato, and creamed spinach while the boyfriend got the King Henry VIII, mashed potatoes and corn. Our meal was served with a salad, which the waiter tossed right in front of us and their traditional Yorkshire pudding! Everything was delicious! I was even more surprised that the boyfriend finished his slice, and got offered a second complimentary slice of prime rib in order to ensure his satisfaction. Towards the end of the meal, the waiters gave all the ladies a rose, to celebrate Valentines day. I've gotta say, that was a nice detail. I was very pleased, and enjoyed every moment of that meal. I'm sure that after this experience, I will never enjoy a slice of Prime Rib the same way.</review>

	<review>I love this place! Although they have other things on the menu, there is really one thing to order. It's obvious as it's in the name and it's what they do best! You can get the prime rib how you want and they give you an extra English cut when you have finished! The atmosphere is great to bring a date. The sides compliment the meal well. Add a little wine and you have a perfect dinner.</review>

	<review>This was my first time at House of Prime Rib along with my girlfriend and we had a great time here. We came here to celebrate my birthday and boy was the treatment here good. The atmosphere was really nice, dim lighting, bar, nice lounge among other things. Our reservation was for 8:30 but we arrived early and they were able to accommodate us and in a matter of 10 minutes we were at our table. The service here was probably the best that we have received..ever! Our waitress Heather was amazing and very friendly. She was very attentive and had a great attitude throughout the entire night. Word of advice for people with small to medium sized stomachs: Don't fill up on the bread and salad! We made the mistake of doing so because it was so delicious; the salad dressing was really good. We were really delighted by the presentation of the food; from Heather preparing the salad in front of us to watching Chef Christian cut our steaks. The food, especially the steak, was hands down the best that I have ever tasted. So tender and well-seasoned. The steaks were accompanied with creamed spinach with bacon, baked potato, mashed potato, creamed corn, and Yorkshire pudding. We were so full by the time we cut into our steaks that we didn't eat much of it. After that, we ordered the bread pudding for dessert and it arrived with a candle on top and  Chef Christian and Heather singing happy birthday (even the couple seated next to us sang along!) I would definitely recommend House of Prime Rib to anyone who loves steak! Thank you again for such a pleasant experience!</review>

	<review>I made a reservation a month in advance and got the exact time/date I wanted, but then plans changed and with only a week to spare, I made a new reservation for the only available time left on the day I'd be in town... an awkward 4:30pm "dinner," but I'll do almost anything for delicious prime rib, including dealing with a messed up meal schedule for a day. Our main quest was Team HoPR vs Team Lawry's (Los Angeles). They have almost identical style and meal prep method (Meat Cart, spinning bowl salad) so it's probably really a matter of where you are. But I had to convince my man that HoPR was superior to Lawry's. I got the house cut, man got the three thinner slices. I got creamed spinach and a baked potato, he got creamed corn and mashed. We decided that neither the spinach nor creamed corn was anything to rave about, and the portion of the creamed corn is kind of sad. The potatoes were delicious though, and I was happy to get giant scoops of butter and bacon on my baked potato. ("My two favorite things!" said our server.) In conclusion, I loooooved my house cut prime rib. Super soft (like budda) and melty in my mouth. Ate it super fast because it was just so good, and then made my way through my potato. The thinner slices were also tasty, but imo a bit too easy to make thin slices tasty? Nice of our server to offer more meat juice when the meat sucked it all up. Oh yeah, and the yorkshire pudding was so good soaked in meat juice. Basically I enjoyed my meat so much that HoPR gets 5 stars, even though my spinach was way too salty. Servers were fun, having a good time, and made for a great atmosphere. Don't wait for a special occasion to make a reservation! Just go!</review>

	<review>I've been here numerous times but I usually come here with my friends for our holiday party during Christmas. I think we've been having our dinners here for 6 years straight already. Parking here can be hell sometimes. Especially during the holiday. I think one year I spent an hour looking for parking... I was late for our reservation but they were accommodating. For those of you that don't feel like driving in circles, they do offer valet parking. Also, if you plan to make reservations for the holiday here... do it EARLY... like 2 months early! I usually book late October... one year I booked in November and the only choice I had was dinner 9pm. So onto the food. The house salad... is soooooooo good. Definitely one of my most favorite salads ever. Well flavored and it looks visually appealing. The cool thing is that they make it in front of your table... the first time eating there it's fun to look at. After seeing it so many times though, you don't pay attention anymore. lol. Then it's time for the main course... the prime rib! Well flavored, juicy... and just AHHHHHHMAZING! The best thing about it? You could get seconds too... it's a thinner cut than the original but that's still nice to get seconds though. The cream corn is really good here... definitely tasty. Mash potatoes are good here... nothing too special about that. Sometimes the gravy can be too salty though. Overall, the meal here is hands down good. Service is really good too, they're on top of everything and friendly. You don't feel rushed, usually there for 2-3 hours. They also have a big pot of mints near the entrance... I usually grab a handful... I know... it's the Asian in me... it can't be helped! Worth a try if you haven't been here yet!</review>

	<review>Wow this place is delicious AND gets you stuffed after eating. The massive amounts of sides that come before the actual prime rib makes for a feast that isn't for those of the weak stomach. The sides are pretty good, and seeing as I don't have to pay extra for it, won't have me complaining about it. They offer two different ways of cutting the meat for the regular size, one giant slab or three thinner slices. I personally went for the English cut (3 thinner slices) and I was not disappointed. The thinner slices of meat made the meat more flavorful with all that sauce smothered around it. Combine that with their spiciest horseradish and you really have something amazing going on there. The waiter was extremely friendly and treated us more like friends rather than someone he was just waiting. Never before have I had a waiter thank me for the tip after I paid which was an unexpected great gesture by him. Great food, great service, great price for what you pay, I will gladly be returning here again in the future!</review>

	<review>The prime rib is ridiculously good!  This review is about two months late but I still drool a little thinking about the prime rib.  I wish that I hadn't snacked before I had gone to the House of Prime Rib.  Not being a big steak eater, my first thoughts were "How good can this place possibly be?", but oh my!  The meat practically melts in your mouth.  I was pleasantly surprised to learn that they also give you seconds with sides for free if you'd like.  The cocktail was good and I was surprised that they give you the entire shaker which came out to about 2 drinks for the price that they charge.   The service was impeccable, prime rib was melt in your mouth, delicious, the dessert was heavenly, and the price for the amount of food that you received wasn't bad at all.  Overall I have nothing bad to say about this place and a definite must visit on my next trip to San Francisco.  Heck, I would fly to San Fran just to go here again.</review>

	<review>This year my family decided to go out to dinner for Thanksgiving at House of Prime Rib since they were the only place open. I usually don't like prime rib but they know how to make a great meal. I had the thinly sliced English cut which was delicious. The meat was so tender and wasn't very fatty unlike every other prime rib I have ever had. I had a baked potato for my side. The baked potato was the most delicious baked potato I have ever had. It was loaded with artery clogging toppings like bacon, butter and sour cream but it was so good. Our waiter was very nice and was in a great mood considering he had to work on Thanksgiving. Prices are very reasonable for a steakhouse in San Francisco. Definitely a place worth checking out.</review>

	<review>You can't really go wrong with a trip to House of Prime Rib, unless you're a vegetarian. And you better come hungry, because you're going to get enough food to feed a small army. As with other traditional prime rib houses (i.e. Lawry's), you get a fresh loaf of warm sourdough bread and very spreadable butter, a house salad made table side, a number of very familiar sides - yorkshire pudding, mashed or baked potato, and cream of corn or spinach - and then your choice of cut of prime rib. The food is exactly what you would expect, hefty and delicious. I bravely went with the king cut and took it rare, just how I like my beef. And with these places where you just know the food and service are going to be top notch, it's the little things that make the place great. And with a beautiful cut of meat in front of you, you also get a trio of horseradishes of various levels of heat. I love that. There are plenty of steakhouses in DC, but I don't think there is a prime rib house. It would be good for us to throw one in there...maybe House of Prime Rib would like to open up on the other side of the country? You'd be welcome.</review>

	<review>This place has the BEST prime rib I have ever had in my life so far. Go here if you like yourself a good piece of MEAT! My boyfriend took me here for our 2 year anniversary.  He told me that he made reservations at least 3 weeks before in order to get a spot. If you come here without a reservation, the wait can easily be 2 hours long. I don't know about you but even when we were waiting for 20 minutes to get a table, my mouth was already watering from all the aroma I was picking up. The menu is very simple, your choice of how big you want your prime rib and it comes with standard sides which you can choose to some extent.  Everything on my plate was really good and I didn't even know what Yorkshire pudding was until I tried it here! At the end of our meal, we ordered creme brulee. I love creme brulee and I always order it at restaurants. Let me tell you, even their creme brulee was really good! The caramelized sugar at the top was perfect and none of it was burnt like some other restaurants end up doing by mistake. Definitely a good place to eat if you want a good meal that fills you up and leaves you happy the rest of the day!!</review>

	<review>-Top notch service -Free seconds, thirds, etc. (you just can't take it home) -LOTS of food for the price. I believe it was about $38 for a 10oz prime rib, fully loaded baked potato, Cesar salad made table-side, Yorkshire pudding &amp; bread. The Yorkshire pudding was a very light, fluffy pastry type pancake that was very delicious!! I never had one and it was really good!! -The prime rib was literally one of the best slabs of meat I have ever tasted. It was so delicious, tender &amp; juicy. I've tried lots of prime rib all over the Bay Area and this has been one of the BEST. I also liked watching the chef cut the meat off the bone, right in front of our table! -One thing that sucks is the slippery floor!! I was wearing wedges, which I have never slipped in &amp; I almost lost my balance while walking to our table!! The floor is a shiny &amp; wooden &amp; for some reason it has no grip... maybe it was just cleaned or polished or something, but ladies, you have been warned!! Don't be wearin no stilettos! -I also want to say you NEED to book a reservation in advance. I had to book 3 months out just to get a dinner reservation on a Sunday evening. Once I got to the restaurant it was packed &amp; now I understand that the restaurant really does fill up!! -All in all, A+ for House of Prime Rib &amp; I will be back!!</review>

	<review>This is already my second time here in 2 months. What I can say is this place serves the best prime rib. The service is very good, which was expected. Even when they were super packed and busy, they respected our time and kept apologizing. They took pride in what they do. Salad was good and consistent. You don't get the same server every time, but the salad comes out the same: delicious. The house bread is very warm and soft, very easy on the mouth. There were 3 flavors of prime rib: city cut, prime rib cut, and king henry. City cut is 7-8 oz. Prime rib cut is 12 oz. King Henry is the full 16 oz and the bone. I think it's best served medium rare and is very delicious and tasty. Their baked potato is great. I prefer baked over mashed. The creamy spinach is delicious as well. For birthdays boys and girls, they sing a song to you very loud so everyone knows. They really are good in this area.</review>

	<review>This review has to be a world record for latest yelp review ever. I came here with my uncle 9.... yes.... 9 years ago. I'm not even sure if I had a yelp account back then or if yelp even existed. Anyways, every time my friends talk about coming here or we drive past it, I always say "I've been there! Its soooo good!" as if I just ate here a day before. Anyways, on with my review. This place was so good that I remember everything single delicious mouth orgasm I had. I came here with a semi full stomach because being an idiot, I had a late lunch. When I arrived, I ordered the House of Prime Rib Cut (totally logical to order a large cut with a full stomach right?). Each order of prime rib comes with hardy "appetizers" which include salad, mashed potatoes, pudding and creamed spinach.  The salad was absolutely delicious. The presentation was amazing as the waiter pours the dressing from above like a waterfall while the salad spins. I was pretty young back then so it was the most amazing thing I've ever seen. The mashed potatoes were amazing, very rich and buttery but light and fluffy. I don't remember how the pudding tasted like because I think it came out at the same time as my meat so it got overshadowed. The spinach reminded me of a fancy version of spinach dip where you dip chips. It was delicious however. Now as for the prime rib. The waiter comes with his cart and cuts the slice in front of you on a plate. This is as fresh as you can get. I cut into it like butter and took my first bite. WOW. The flavor of the meat was amazing; perfectly cooked and seasoned flawlessly. You can taste the natural flavor of the prime rib mixed with the light saltiness of the dry rub marinade on the outside. Absolutely amazing. I finished my entire cut. I wasn't offered another however as I heard you can get second serving for free. As for dessert, I ordered creme brule and this, again, was delicious. Perfectly baked with the crunchy top. I came here with a full stomach and still ate every single bite of food on the table. The food was so good that the mechanism that controls the fullness in my stomach was turned off. The pricing at this place is very reasonable for the amount of food you get and for a fine meal at an upscale restaurant. Everything about this restaurant is perfect from the service to the food. I haven't found another occasion to come back here but after writing this review, I'm salving. I'll definitely be back in the near future.</review>

	<review>After so many years of driving by this place I finally got to try it out. Now I know why it's been so popular for the longest time. This is a classic no-frills joint with awesome food and good drinks. The decor is very old school with dim lighting, red booths, and old photos and paintings everywhere.  All the staff wears uniforms. As far as I can tell, the menu hasn't changed for a long time. But if the place is still packed night after night, why would you? The quality of the food speaks or itself. The bread, the salad, baked potato, creamed spinach, and prime rib were all delicious.  I guess the only thing that's changed is the price going up a bit over the years but that is completely expected. I had a great meal and I'm glad I went.</review>

	<review>My two girlfriends were meeting up with friends in San Fran so they left me, the bf and another guy friend to fend for ourselves for dinner.  Yelp to the rescue! I saw the reviews for the House of Prime Rib and knew we had to go during our visit to San Fran.  I made reservations at 9:30 pm on a Friday.  I knew it would be busy but I thought the reservations would be followed somewhat close.  I'm not really sure how their system worked because I felt like people who showed up after us were seated before us.   Anyway, I wasn't really hungry at the time so I wasn't overly upset but after 45 mins after the reservation time, the bf was a bit peeved.  Finally we were seated and I was happy that they acknowledged their error in wait time. The table came with sourdough bread and butter.  The bread was nice and toasty, just as it should be.  I tried really hard not to fill myself with bread but it was really good.  The bf and I split the King Henry VIII Cut, which included a $7.50 minimum charge for me.  That's just fine with me because I wasn't about to get a piece all for myself.   They started us off with a house salad that they tossed in front of us.  Pretty cool.  Then the zeppelin came over and they carved us a piece right in front of us.  Such an awesome experience.  It came with a side of mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.  Both sides were pretty good.  They brought out Yorkshire pudding and it was my first time trying it.  I wasn't really wowed by it though.   The prime rib itself is MELT IN YOUR MOUTH GOODNESS.  I've had prime rib before and was never really a fan.  Now I know what quality tastes like.  It was one of the best tasting foods I've ever had. And even though we were on the verge of exploding, we had to try desserts.  The strawberry shortcake was so light and fresh that we couldn't stop eating it (I would totally come back just for this).   The chocolate cake was my second favorite with three layers of chocolate.  The tiramisu was the miss of the table in my opinion.   I know there was a long wait after my reservation but I still think the House of Prime Rib made up for it in folds, both with the food and the service.</review>

	<review>When I was little, aka a kid, I used to come here with my parents. When I ate at House of Prime Rib, I was as ecstatic as I could possibly be. Coming back here again for a belated Valentine's Day dinner, with a large group, I surely felt the same as we waited to be seated. Now, this restaurant is "old school" - in the sense that the overall decor and ambiance is kind of a blast into the past - considering the overall rise of trendy restaurants in SF (hipsters?). Nonetheless, the decor is very elegant. I'd have to say the customers eating at the restaurant are "older" than what you would see at a trendier restaurant. Honestly, those were only my initial observations as I impatiently waited to be seated/get my food. My particular favorites at House of Prime Rib are obviously, the prime rib, as well as their salad!!! The dressing is incredible. The prime rib is juicy and tender, and very filling. And for those of you with bad self control, please try not to eat too much bread before your prime rib arrives! You don't want to fill yourself up on the bread before the food comes. It may be tempting give that the bread is warm when it's served, but you won't be able to enjoy the prime rib nearly as much! This is a unique dining establishment in San Francisco - and they are very good at what they do. Service was pretty good too - the menu is very straightforward, but our server was really helpful, personable, and patient amidst a very large group of people!</review>

	<review>Great food, great drinks, great service, but also a great expense.  LOL.  If there are two people eating, you can expect a $100 minimum tab if you don't want to drink... quite a bit more if you do.  The Raspberry Lemon Drop is definitely worth a try, and the Manhattan is a good one too. I've been here twice and both times we had reservations, but were seated about a half hour after our reservation each time.  Just something to be aware of.  It is rather loud in most areas of the restaurant when it's busy, however they do have secluded areas that you can request if you're trying to have a romantic date. I usually get the house cut and my boyfriend gets the King Henry cut.  They'll give you a free second helping if you finish, which is really cool.  I've never taken advantage of this but my boyfriend definitely has!  The bread is warm and fresh, the salad is gigantic and tossed in front of you with their tasty house dressing, and the prime rib definitely lived up to expectations for me.</review>

	<review>Came here for a paid business dinner. They start you off with delicious bread, which you should avoid filling up on. Then they give you a huge plate of delicious salad, which you should avoid filling up on. Then they bring out the prime rib, and the real fun starts. How good could prime rib be? I mean I've had it at almost every buffet I've been to? The answer: take all the goodness of every prime rib I've ever eaten anywhere else, combine it, and it might get close to the level of how good the prime rib is here. PS. I'm not a snob, but if you're getting your prime rib well-done, urdoinitwrong. Sides were delicious, though I didn't have enough stomach space to finish them all because the prime rib is HUGE. I got the creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. I also ordered the Green Apple martini and the Lemon Drop cocktail. The cocktails come with a shaker that has two more full pours in it, though the last pour is a little diluted. Overall, an amazing meal if you love prime rib. Might be too expensive, not to mention too heavy on the calories, to eat at often, but for a special occasion it's great. Don't bring any vegetarians or any people who like to order fish at a prime rib joint here. Though they do have fish, I wonder who actually orders it.</review>

	<review>This classic San Francisco spot is THE place to get your prime rib on. Since 1949, the HOPR has been the ultimate celebration spot in my opinon. The classic menu has been around every since. I was invited to dinner along with my guy and his coworker, after thier conference. I was so happy to be the third wheel and tag along. When you make reservations at the HOPR ("hopper"), you should prepare yourself and no snacking beforehand. Even the center cut is a challange, but I proudly take it on "medium rare"style. To start, I ordered a glass of the Clois Du Bois Cabernet Savingon, it goes well with dinner and only $7.50 a glass. They bring you fresh baked bread with butter, which I requested horseradish. I like to mix the horseradish with the butter for a zing and less calorie spread. They have three types of horseradish, pure heat, medium and a mixed horseradish spread that is lighter. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… They serve the house spun salad (note: this salad is spun in a chilled bowl over ice and not tossed) with homemade thousand island dressing. It must be the method that makes this salad so good. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… They serve you corn shaped corn bread with the salad, but don't fill up on bread! For my meal, I went with what I always order - the best. The City Cut with the mashed potatoes, gravy and the creamed spinach. When it was served to me, I noticed the heart in my mashed potatoes. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… I often crave the creamed spinach, as it's not what you think - it's so much better. My guy ordered the same cut with the loaded baked potato. It was so big, it looked like an entire meal on it's own. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… With the sauteed spinach, he wanted to try something new and it was just ok. Not quite the delectable creamed spinach. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… At the end of my meal, I stared at my plate feeling glorius for completing the steak. No dessert was needed, I was happy as hell with my dinner and ready to slip into a well deserved food coma. We had great service, our waitress was so friendly and accomodating. We all enjoyed our meal and were treated with a complimentary photo after we were done. It came out great because of the huge grins on our happy faces.</review>

	<review>JUST GO. The House of Prime Rib ought to be declared a San Francisco landmark, for it does the rarest of things...it lives up to its publicty. I heard about THOPR years ago, found out that my parents dined there decades ago and they STILL remember the meal. So I wondered, "could it still be that good?" And the answer is a resounding YES!!! This is old school San Francisco---dark wood paneled walls, gracious service, a limited menu in which everything compliments the main course, an unhurried atmosphere (and I was here on Mother's Day, one of the busiest days in the restaurant biz), and a cordial ambience where the owner went to each table to see if everything was as it should be. Could this be the 21st century??!!! Yep. The prime rib was superb---I had dreams about it the next night it was SO delicious. Both the creamed spinach and the mashed potatoes were excellent, not just some "filler on a plate", but truly delicious in their own right. The salad and the Yorkshire pudding rounded out a terrific meal, and the wine, although ordered just by the glass, was a worthy accompaniment to the meal itself ( a nice 2008 Carneros Pinot Noir by Gloria Ferrer). How anyone could have room for dessert, heaven only knows, because I was completely satisfied and just asked the waitress to SEE the dessert menu out of sheer curiousity! The next time you have a SPECIAL OCCASION that deserves celebrating, where $$$ is secondary to making great memories---a graduation, a promotion, an engagement, etc.---go to The House Of Prime Rib, you won't regret it!</review>

	<review>As you can see, House of Prime Rib lives up to its name &amp; reviews. I've wanted to go here since I was in high school, &amp; finally, for my birthday in January, I was able to experience one of the best prime rib joints San Francisco has to offer. As soon as my boyfriend &amp; I were arrived, we were seated in the waiting area by the fireplace &amp; were offered drinks.  The wait wasn't even necessary since they had our table ready within 3-4 minutes but it was really nice just sitting by the fireplace to get warmed up to the place.   The wine - I ordered a cabernet &amp; was more than satisfied. The salad - SOOO good! I know I had to save room for the prime rib, but I couldn't help myself.  I ate all of mine &amp; some of my boyfriend's too! The creamed corn - Probably the best creamed corn I've ever tried.  It was a TEENY bit too creamy for me, but I tend to like my creamed corn on the watery/liquid side. Still delicious nonetheless. The creamed spinach - My boyfriend ordered it, so I was able to try both.  I'm not a big spinach person, but I actually found myself picking at the creamed spinach more than I thought I would. The prime rib - AMAZING. I was so determined to finish everything on my plate &amp; as full as I was, I couldn't stop.  The prime rib itself was so tender &amp; cooked at a PERFECT medium rare (which I personally think is a little hard to achieve).  The au jus sauce, as great as it was, probably didn't even have to be there for me to love the prime rib. Nonetheless, both captured my carnivorous heart.   Since we came for my birthday, the server came out with dessert &amp; a happy birthday song.  On top of that, they even took a picture of us &amp; framed it with their own HOPR frame.  It was really sweet.   I'm not one for big hype, but I have to say, House of Prime Rib is a delicious &amp; satisfying exception.</review>

	<review>Excellent food!  Was visiting from LA.  I ordered the prime rib (of course) and it was cooked perfectly.  Even good the next day as leftovers, which you will probably have b/c the portions are more than generous.  And everybody seems to leave with a doggy bag Good value too, since salad and sides are included with the meal. And the service was also excellent!  Prompt, polite and very thorough</review>

	<review>YUM YUM YUM!!!! I came here for my birthday with reservations. Parking was pretty hard to find, but it took us about 20 minutes to find which wasn't too bad. Since we arrived early before our reservation time, we ordered drinks at the bar. The bartender was nice and gave me a drink on the house.  My server was super nice and provided really great service! The food was super yummy! At the beginning, they provide you sourdough bread. I didn't touch any of it because I didn't want to get full off of that. Salad was yummy but I only ate half of it. My sides were the mash potatoes and the cream corn. They were pretty good too. For my prime rib, I had the HoPR cut. It was soo good and the portion was perfect! It was freaking juicy and the sauce was DELICIOUS. Very tender! It also came with the yorkshire pudding. It was sooo delicious and it tasted even better when I dipped it in my prime rib's sauce. At the end of my meal, the server gave us a dessert with a candle, sang a song, and took a picture for us to take home and remember. It was a great experience!</review>

	<review>Imagine a place where the meat is tender and gigantic, the sides are delicious and plentiful, and the service is excellent.  This is that place.  It's amazing in every way, and I wish I could eat there every night.  It's too bad its so pricey, or I really would. Their menu is so simple, basically just how big of a slice of prime rib do you want?  You get salad, mashed or baked potato, creamed corn or creamed spinach, and yorkshire pudding with the meal.  Everything was amazing, and everything is served tableside.  Awesome. I got the regular sized prime rib - it was huge.  And they give you another slice if you ask for it at the end of the meal.  You know, in case the gigantic slab you got for your dinner portion wasn't enough.  One thing they'll never have to worry about is people complaining about the food not being enough. It's just ridiculous how good the food is, I'll definitely be back!</review>

	<review>I've been putting off this review for the longest time for fear that I would crave it but too late--and this place gets the honor of my 300th review! Reservations are a must and they get booked quickly. Be sure to have all members of your party present to be seated, they are really strict about that. I got the medium cooked medium rare. For a measly 50 bucks (tax and tip) you get: - sourdough bread - freshly made salad - baked/mashed potato - creamed spinach/corn or both - Yorkshire pudding But simply put, the prime rib is the obvious star here. OMG, I can almost imagine the velveetty texture of the prime rib melting in my mouth, dissolving into pure ecstacy. Oh man. Every bite was better than the one that preceded it. The GREAT thing is they offer additional pieces if you are looking to eat more, but I definitely did not want to overdo it as I was beyond content and didn't want to ruin that. Service was top notch, I felt like I was being treated like a celebrity up in there. I love the feel of the restaurant, homey, warm, cozy, classy. There is no way I will NOT come here if I am ever in the area.</review>

	<review>I came here with my boyfriend to celebrate our anniversary, and it was absolutely one of the finest dinner I've ever had.  We both ordered the King Henry VIII Cut, with the baked potato. I kept munching on the bread while we waited for our salads, and it was nice and fresh out of the oven. My boyfriend had to stop me from munching on any longer to leave room for our main course.  Our salads came and it was also delicious. This time I stopped myself from finishing the salad because I was probably feeling around 1/3 full and I definitely needed to leave room for the main dish. When our steaks finally came, we were drooling at the sight and couldn't wait to dig in. The first bite was soo delicious and the sauce was PERFECT, omg. Best steak ever. The baked potato was also delicious, but our server added A LOT of bacon that I could've lived without, but nonetheless, it was really good. I only took a few bites from it and took the rest to go because the steak was filling enough as is and i was barely half done. And the spinach.... well, I don't like spinach, so I acted like a little kid and scraped it onto my boyfriends plate, teehee. :) [the spinach touched my yorshire pudding and it ruined it for me :( ] Overall, one of the best experiences at a restaurant I've ever had. Good service, waiter was really nice and attentive to our needs. And the food was absolutely delicious. Sidenote: my boyfriend and I got lucky with parking, but you usually tend to take a while to find parking in the area.</review>

	<review>This was one of the most talked about prime rib restaurants among my friends and it was on San Francisco's 7x7 top 100 things to eat before you die. It was an obvious sign that I had to go there to try it out,  Never was a big prime rib fan until i came here, if you're gonna get prime rib here.. get the KING's CUT !!  The slice is what they call a very generous cut, i had about doubt about their version of generous compare to my version of generous. They definitely prove me wrong with the big slice of prime rib on my dish, they great thing about this place is that you can get as much prime rib as you can eat, but after the first cut, the following slices weren't as "generous" but it was okay for me, because after the first slice i was about 80% full, didn't wanna go all and not leave room for dessert. This place is as amazing as everyone had put it, i would definitely go back !</review>

	<review>They serve nothing but the best in Prime Rib. I've been to this establishment twice and love the entire dining experience here. I'm in love with that pink, juicy, tender, tasty meat that comes to my table under the Zeppelin-looking serving container. Tonight's event, I had dinner with my gf and her 2 brothers. We all ordered much the same medium servings, and still left with a doggie bag in the end. HOPR serves generous portions of food.</review>

	<review>If you love prime rib, you'll love this place.  It's a little like going back in time, very old school with the silver meat carts that carve your prime rib tableside, but that's all part of its wonderful charm.   A couple tips that may be helpful: order a cocktail. They do cocktails very, very well shaken in a ice cold shaker that they leave at your table and pretty much contains another full drink after you finish your first. Order the house of prime rib cut. Even if it's too much food,  it's the right thickness of cut and who doesn't love leftovers?!  Ask for all the horseradishes, it's fun to sample all the different ones. Both the creamed corn and creamed spinach are great (have someone in your party order the one you don't so you can share), and enjoy the yorkshire pudding (so delicious), just don't ask how many calories are in it.  On the off chance you finish all of your prime rib, and my dad miraculously has, they will give you a small slice (a "topper," if you will) if you want just a little bit more.   Overall, the experience is as good as the food, it's just one of those special places that you absolutely have to try if you haven't already!</review>

	<review>This place is probably one of the best places to eat in San Francisco!!  Meal was well worth it!  My boyfriend took me here for a dinner date and we were excited to eat! Made reservations at 7:30 and got sat right away!  Their service was really good.  The decor and ambiance is somewhat on the older, more vintage side.  You can definitely tell this place has been around for a long time! Our server came and introduced himself soon after we sat and brought out a basket of bread for us.  We ordered a bottle of red wine since my boyfriend loves red.  He got the King Henry cut, and I got the English cut.   Our entree came with their special house salad.  It was a great performance on how they served it.  I loved the beets in them - sweet and tingy!  Entree was even better.  I really liked my dish since it was thinly sliced.  My boyfriend even got the "free" second slice.   I was too full to even finish mine. For dessert, we ordered the strawberry shortcake.  It was oh, so delicious!

	<review>All time favorite restaurant. I have been going here since birth and have never left disappointed. Prime rib is the best you will have ever tasted, and the yorkshire pudding, creamed spinach, mashed potatoes and salad that come with it are second to none. Its amazing to see how popular this restaurant has become over the years, and with good reason. The service is fantastic, prices are moderate. The only possible negative that can be said, is that parking is valet only, but definitely worth it!</review>

	<review>Been here a couple times now and it was s great experience every time. Had reservations at 7PM, got there at 6:58PM, got seated at maybe 7:03PM? Sat, down then had our server (Sean) greet us. We pretty much order on the spot seeing how there aren't that many options. I won't go into anything that hasn't been gone over in detail before about how the meal works. I just wanted to say that the food is always good and the service that Sean added made it that much better. He made sure everything was going and was able to find the balance between coming to check on us and not completely bothering us. Amazing service and food.</review>

	<review>A completely amazing experience. My mom and dad have been coming to this place for a very long time, so we the children were very excited to finally get to try it and they did not disappoint. The prime rib was cooked to the perfect medium rare, was juicy, tender, and just outright deliciously meaty. There isn't a single thing I can really say negative about this place--basically everything (the salad, the yorkshire pudding, the warm bread, etc) was great. The table they initially seated us at just wasn't big enough and they reseated us quickly and without a problem. Our waitress was not only nice, but also had spunk and personality. The feel and sort of cheesy decor makes you sort of feel like you are in a scene from one of The Godfather movies, which is totally rad in my humble opinion. If you are even considering coming here, especially on a weekend, it will definitely behoove you to make a reservation.</review>

	<review>The prime rib here is some of the very best I have ever had. It melts within my mouth. The salad is fantastic, with a fabulous dressing to go with it. The sides (especially the spinach and the YORKSHIRE PUDDING) are top-notch. There is nothing about this restaurant that does not beg me to come back.</review>

	<review>I hadn't been to the house of prime rib in more than two years and then I ended up going twice in about 3 weeks. I always liked the place but this last time I went it was heavenly. I've never been much a prime rib man more of a steak guy, but wow is all I can say. I got the King Henry cut and really there's no other cut you should be getting if you looking at the price. Firstly, the hot sourdough bread if a fantastic way to start things off. Next the salad was great as always and finished my plate off no problem. Now the prime rib(rare) was seasoned to perfection and the au jus is a match made in heaven. It's the best prime rib you can get bar none. The yorkshire pudding is also pretty damn good too. I actually finished the King Henry Cut and got the extra slice on the house and the last taste was as good as the first. House of Prime Rib just do it....and you have to make reservations.</review>

	<review>Just wanted to say it was a great experience. Excellent service, great prime rib. Most of us in our party of five took the King Henry VIII cut and completely devoured it. Yorkshire pudding fantastic esp when its soaking up the au jus. We all had a different dessert. It was the first time ever having dinner in which all of us finished everything including second servings and dessert and not one of us took home a doggie bag or felt sickly full. Just impressive.</review>

	<review>Not to sound like a broken record but this place is awesome! From the warm bread and butter sitting on our table when we were seated to the deliciously delectable cut of beef to the yorkshire pudding and creamed spinach/corn, everything was so so good! The ambience was classic San Francisco and the service was fantastic. We made our reservations for 4pm, when they open on the weekends and there was a crowd so come early/on time for your table! Don't have a single complaint about this place and can't wait to go back in November!</review>

	<review>Went here to celebrate my birthday and omg was it good! Place was packed late on a Sunday night which gave me a good indication that I was in for a treat. The bread was  amazing. Delicious sourdough that I had to tell the waiter to take away because I would have devoured the entire thing. Wish I could've taken one home with me, it was so fresh and flavorful. Salad was delicious, just as everybody says. I don't know what's in that dressing, but I wish they sold it so I could buy some. At this point in the meal, I was getting pretty excited for the prime rib since nothing had let me down at this point. It was amazing. Thick and juicy and flavorful. I wish I had more stomachs so I could eat more. I got a loaded baked potato with it (and they really load it up good) and the creamed spinach. Couldn't finish it all and ended up taking some home. Still wanted to try dessert though and got the creme brule, which was the perfect way to end the meal. By the time we left, past 10, there were still people waiting for their seats. The pricing was also pretty reasonable too I think. I've definitely spent more money on a meal at other restaurants without feeling nearly as full. Good place to go if you're celebrating something, there were a lot of groups that night celebrating birthdays.</review>

	<review>I watched an episode of Anthony Bourdain: No Reservation show, and he was in San Francisco, and the House of Prime Rib was one of the restaurants featured on the show.  We love prime rib, and it looked so amazing, so we had to experience it ourselves.  We went there two years ago for our anniversary.  The prime rib is carved tableside, and it came with tossed salad, creamed spinach, mash potatoes and Yorkshire pudding.  The food was indeed amazing and service was very good.  They even took a photo of us after dinner which was a nice touch.</review>

	<review>Awesome prime rib! If the only prime rib you've ever eaten was the Vegas buffet variety, well you've been sorely misled about what prime rib is supposed to taste and feel like, both on the your tongue and in your belly! This is some of best tear-inducing beef you will ever taste and is well worth the $60 or so per head (including cocktails, soda, and dessert but no wine). Couple things to think about: 1. Get the King Henry Cut. No matter what. Now some people like English Cut, which I disparagingly call the Princess Cut since women seem to order it quite a bit. It's thinner cut, so it absorbs more of the juices, but it lacks that slight chewiness that you want when you're biting into a piece of flesh. It taste more like roast beef than prime rib. With the King Henry, you get a bone so get all different types of textures and flavors going on when you have the bone there. 2. Go easy on the Big Mac Salad. Okay, it's not really called that, but it's a salad that comes near the beginning of the meal that tastes like a Big Mac. It's delicious, but it can fill you up. Also, tell them to go easy on the dressing; it's a bit heavy if they put the whole pitcher of dressing on the salad. 3. Go easy on all the sides. Yes you get fresh sourdough bread. Yes you get cornbread. Yes you get your choice of a huge baked potato with all the fixings or mash potatoes with gravy. Yes you get your choice of creamed corn or cream spinach. Yes you get all that, but remember, YOU CAME FOR THE BEEF! Once you finish your portion of beef, you are able to get another piece. And remember, you can't recreate this prime rib at home, but everything else you probably could. Other highlights from our last visit was a complimentary choice of sparkling or still water, Josh our waiter being entertaining while professional, and the attentive service by the rest of the staff. At the beginning our drink orders were taken. Before we got our drinks, the maitre d' directed us to our tables and informed the waitress to have our drinks brought to the table. When we saw that the table was going to be a bit tight for our party, we went back to the waiting room. As we were sitting down I wanted to go to our waitress to let her know that were weren't seated in the dining room but the maitre d' was already on top of it. Great service. Another example of great service was when my friend had dropped his napkin on the ground. He had no idea that he had dropped it and he only realized it when one of the waitstaff had returned with a clean, fresh one. At first my friend was confused because he didn't know where his original napkin had gone, but when I explained it to him, we were all thoroughly impressed by how responsive, quick, and efficient the service was. Great all around and a restaurant we should go to more than once every couple years. Well deserving of at least once a year even with the high price tag.</review>

	<review>If I could I would give this place 5+++ stars, an extra + for the things that went above and beyond our expectations: +: We were brought to a table that was a bit small and was quickly upgraded to a roomier spot since we had little 9 month old Emma with us. +: We were given a cocktail suggestion that tasted like cough syrup and mentioned that it wasn't to our liking. We were not charged. +: Stellar service by our waiter: Josh - lots of fun energy and very attentive. He even convinced us to eat less of the salad so we had more of a chance to make it to the extra slice of prime rib. Besides the BEST PRIME RIB EVER, the sides are good, the appetizer snacks are tasty (Asian cracker mix from Costco), free sparkling water, good cocktails (besides the one bomb we tried) and a great atmosphere. I was impressed by how cozy it felt though the restaurant is much larger than you first think. Definitely make reservations, although if you have to wait the large lounge area is not a bad place to hang out for a while. Grab a cocktail and some of those snacks and prepare for a great meal.</review>

	<review>Came here twice, once for my birthday last year and a couple months ago with the bf's parents. The place is not cheap but I wouldn't say it's expensive, especially for all the food you get and the wonderful 'experience' they set out to give you. It definitely gives a special occasion type of atmosphere with a fun and cozy atmosphere that still feels classy. Amazing salad, I probably can't get enough of it. I never really cared for beets but ever since coming here I look for beet salad everywhere in hope of having something as good. I love that they make it in front of you, it really adds fun and relaxes the place. Generally huge portions for everything, the meat cart comes right to your table and slabs of perfectly cooked tender meat is served onto your plate with a delicious simple gravy and a yorkshire pudding. Amazing prime rib. The yorkshire pudding is nothing to amaze but it's good and rare to get so I enjoyed it. I would definitely recommend the baked potato over the mashed as it is definitely amazing and jam packed with whatever you desire. Stiff drinks and great service, I don't think we've ever had room for dessert. Left both times with a smile though!</review>

	<review>House of Prime Rib has definitely won me over and become, my favorite restaurant!! Located on Van Ness Ave this place is perfect for any occassion...My boyfriend and I have celebrated numerous of our birthdays here... last year I wanted to take him somewhere "different" and opted for another steak house which was definitely a disappointment and we wished we were at House of Prime Rib instead... so this year, we have officially decided that we know what we like, and we stick with it! haha... Whats extra special about your birthday or a special occasion here is that they will take a picture of you and your group to take home (: I really like the ambiance here, there are numerous dining rooms, lively, dimly lit, relaxing, comfortable with a family feel.  We like to start at the bar with a cocktail before dinner...I love the simply, basic menu- salad, prime rib, mashed potatoes &amp; spinach! i strongly recommend ordering the "King Cut" which is always a better cut and you'll get to take some home! Or bring the bone home for your pup... This place is awesome!!! I am taking my boyfriend for his bday this week!!</review>

	<review>I recently went here for my parents' wedding anniversary and I've been here a few times.  Our waitress was very helpful and the staff was accommodating with my stroller and having a highchair.  That's a plus for me!   Anyway, for the price you pay, I feel you do get a lot of food.  The bread was really good and we were even given cornbread (my fav).  The salad was "ok" to me.  I ordered the city cut prime rib (med rare) and to my surprise, I wasn't able to finish it!  It was really good and the variety of horseradish made it better!  I mixed the medium with hot and it was soooo good!  I ordered the baked potato with everything and the corn.  It sure was a lot and I even ordered dessert!  I ordered the creme brulee and it was good too!  Oh, the house pinot noir isn't bad either.</review>

	<review>THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!  What an anniversary dinner we had! I definitely picked the right spot for a very special occasion. I made reservation months prior because it's packed on weekends. I was amazed from the staffs, they were very professional and friendly, what a class act. Everything in this place is fancy and nicely decorated. It has a bar and small tables for you to sit while you wait for your table. Our experience here was very enjoyable; also our server was so energetic and helpful, and about the food, oh man! VERY DELICIOUS! Best prime rib I've had in years. I'll definitely return to this place!!</review>

	<review>After making our reservations over a month and a half ago, I wasn't sure this place would live up to the hype.  But after our experience last night I can safely say that YES, IT DID!!! Our reservation was for 6:30 but we arrived at 6:25.  We waited at the bar for about 10 minutes but while we were there the bartender was great.  Our drinks were delicious (strong but delicious).  When our table was ready, they walked us to our table and carried our drinks on a tray for us.  Once we got to our table, we met our server Cara.  Since this was our first time there, she took the time to explain the menu to us.  It was pretty simple, choose the cut of meat and then your sides (I love easy).   What we couldn't believe was how much food we got for the price we paid.  We've been to other places like Ruth Chris and Harris and you have to fork over an arm and a leg for your sides.  You get bread, cornbread and salad (before the main even comes out).  We both got the House of Prime Rib cut, I chose the cream spinach and my husband got the cream of corn.  Both were absolutely delicious.  We also got the baked potato (wow) and yorkshire pudding.  We had never tried yourkshire pudding but it was definitely a great addition.  And because the dinner experience was so great, we even ordered a dessert.  We got the warm apple crisp (Cara recommended the english triffle but we weren't in the mood to try something new).  The apple crisp was great, my husband said he would go back just for that.   Overall, our first experience at House of Prime Rib was definitely worth the wait.  I can't tell you how awesome it is to have an overall wonderful dining experience.  We left this place with full stomachs and huge smiles on our face.  We will DEFINITELY be coming back... soon!!!</review>

	<review>Another one of my favorites!  Good for special occasions,  birthdays, anniversaries... celebrate with a big hunk of PRIME RIB!  if you're a vegetarian this is not the place for you.  Oh wait, you can fill up on their salad, which i love, love, love!  YES please give me extra salad!!  And did you know they sell their own dressing?  Yes buy a bottle... its soooooo good!  Yorkshire pudding what is that?  Dunk it in the Au Ju and yum yum... so good.  Everything about this place is yummy and did you know if you finish the prime rib on your plate they will give you another slice?  I always end up taking the prime rib and potatoes home becuz i fill up on salad but then when i get home i see the prime rib and finish that up before i go to bed...  oh wow... now i gotta go make reservations for at least 2 weeks out cuz they are always booked up unless you want an 1030pm reservation.</review>

	<review>I have been coming here since I was child over 20 years ago!  This place is as good as it gets, in terms of prime rib.  I never fully appreciated this place until I left SF for LA and was served a mediocre substitute commonly know as Lawry's.  On a recent trip to SF, I made a late night reservation for dinner with my family and relived my childhood memories of birthdays and celebrations from the past.  It wouldn't be the same if Gus wasn't there.   Down to business.  I had the King Henry cut served with baked potato, creamed spinach and corn.  All the items were served perfectly.  This place is all about what is so wrong and how good it can be.  Big slabs of beef served with potatoes that are filled with all things Holy (i.e., bacon, sour cream, butter), creamed spinach dotted with bacon, and heaps of creamed corned which is exactly the way it was intended to be, creamy buttery goodness.  The rest of my table mates had the same and yes, that includes all the ladies as well. Wash it all down with a dry gin martini and you're on cloud 9.  However, to reach the ultimate experience, save room for dessert and order the fantasy cake, a devilish combination of cheesecake and devil's food cake.   Do as I do and you will not be disappointed.</review>

	<review>Asian parents will love this place. Good prime rib, huge portions, extra sides by request, and a second cut for free? And you take home all of your leftovers in a doggy bag? It doesn't get any better than this. This place is asian parent heaven. It's just a good solid meal for under $50 bucks (w/o wine). Don't be a sucker, get the baked potato and not the mashed. The creamed spinach is solid. Yorkshire pudding is great. Gotta soak up those juices. The salad doesn't look like much, but tastes fantastic. I've always made a reservation, and never had an issue w/ the wait time. Recently went back for a second time and confirmed that the first was as awesome as I remembered it to be.</review>

	<review>I've been coming here for 17 years and this place has been awesome every time. I've also been to Broadway Prime and others...once. There is no beating this place for Prime Rib. The beef is tender and flavorful. I always get the a la carte so that no salad gets in the way of me and my beef. Their creamed spinach is also very tasty, but watch out it's filling and YOU KNOW you want to make it to that second piece of prime rib ;) They get busy during dinner hours, so even with a reservation you may end up waiting up to 40 minutes. That's not acceptable for some so be warned. I take it as a House of Prime Rib reality. To me the meal is worth the wait. The service is great though. This year I tore my achilles and was on crutches when I visited. They were very accomodating and helped make my visit another memorable one.</review>

	<review>If you love meat, this is the place to go.  I had the King Henry cut with the creamed spinach, baked potato, with the Yorkshire pudding.  i figured I would get the biggest cut since there is only a $6 difference between the smallest and biggest cut.  If you come to a place like this, you have to go all out.  I got medium rare and the prime rib was exactly that.  It had a great consistency and was really juicy when you bite into it.  I honestly think you can cut this meat with a fork because its so tender.  They serve the meat with three kinds of horseradish sauce(mild, medium, hot).  I preferred the medium as it was mixed with some kind of garlic mayonnaise.  The creamed spinach and baked potato aren't deal breakers by any means.  They are the besta baked potato and creamed spinach can be.  As for the Yorkshire pudding, I've never had anything like this before, but once they told me it was for soaking up the Au jus, I was sold.  I guess if you finish your meat too, they ask you if you want more.  I asked if it was extra and they said no, I guess its a little reward for finishing.  I'm not sure if this was just for the King Henry cut or others too, but I took advantage and just took the rest home.  All in all a very very good place for meat lovers.</review>

	<review>Our service was great here from the minute we stepped through the door. Drinks taken quickly by the hostess while we were waiting on our reservation and then the ticket was transferred over to our table when it was ready. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.  The ambiance is so neat too! Very old and fancy feeling inside. The food was awesome! Prime Rib covered in horseradish, mashed potatoes with a delicious gravy and creamed spinach. It was a wonderful dining experience. You get so much food for the price. I can't wait to go back! YUM!</review>

	<review>I had the opportunity to visit San Francisco and my delightful hosts opted to take me to the HOPR for dinner.  I'm an unapologetic carnivore and as such, Prime RIb is about my most favorite meat.  I know, I know, you're saying "You visited San Francisco and just had Prime Rib?  The culinary capital of the West Coast and a bloody slab of meat is all you got?" Now, now, while I would characterize the meat as being somewhat slab-like, (because yes, I did go for the BIG cut)...blood was minimal as I prefer a medium rare cut.  Service was impeccable, the salad prepared table side was SUPERB and my baked potato was pure delight, fully loaded with artery hardening goodness. The food was great, the company even better and it was wonderful to have an absolutely perfect meal without any pressure to vacate the table for another party.</review>

	<review>Best prime rib. Ever. I've been to this restaurant since I was at least 10 years old, and they have never disappointed me! I usually purchase the English Cut. Their Yorkshire Pudding is yummy, mashed potatoes so flavorful! The House of Prime Rib salad is also very flavorful! But I don't like their side dishes of corn or spinach. But I think I am the type of person who doesn't like cream on vegetables. I don't know if they still offer the Peach Melba, but if they do, get it! I think the price they charge for what they offer is pretty fair. If you do come to this restaurant, make reservations! If you don't, it's going to be very difficult for you to get a table, since they are busy practically everyday. Especially if it's Valentine's Day or some important holiday, make reservations a month in advance if possible!</review>

	<review>I die for this place! Ok no, but this place is one of my favorites! The prime rib is cooked to perfection. juicy, delicious, thick, tender and forget-you're-on-a-diet-good. excellent service, nice, yet comfortable atmosphere and worth every penny. Make reservations though! even if it's within a few hours, theyre usually able to work something out. walk ins normally wait 45+mins. Alll of the sides are delish but my personal picks are the creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. Don't miss out on the Yorkshire pudding and say yes to extra dressing on the salad. This place is good if you're on a date or having a large (or small) dinner party, HOPR will accommodate your wants/needs for a good night with good company. *they always offer seconds,too. For the freee</review>

	<review>Awesome.... If you have never been here and you are a proud meat eater then you NEED to check this place out.  Prime Rib is what's for dinner and is the only thing on the menu.  You have your choice in how many ounces you feel like eating  as well as how you want it cooked and that is it.  Also, if you are still hungry after you have cleaned your plate (IF you have cleaned your plate) you can ask for one more slice of prime rib deliciousness.. Awesome... no seriously... Awesome.   They start you off with a really yummy salad which they prepare table side, fresh baked HOT bread, and of course the drinks are Wonderful.  They are not stingy on their drinks. What is that? You want a Manhattan? Well be prepared to drink about two and a half of them with just one order. Awesome.... The meat is cut and plated with your choice of sides right in front of you.  The atmosphere is welcoming and wonderful.  If I hadn't started to go straight into a food coma after my meal I would have stayed around for some desert.  Seeing as my husband and I both felt a little like gluttons (in a good way of course) after the meal we decided to just head home and digest on our couch.  Awesome. Make a reservation.  They are really good at being on time so if you make it for 7:30 then you will be seated at 7:30.  Get there early and sit at the bar. Without a reservation you may find yourself waiting 1-2 hours just for a table.</review>

	<review>I LOVE LOVE LOVE the House of Prime Rib.  My family and I have been coming here for my dad's birthday for the last 5 or six years and it is always great. (make sure you get your picture if you're here for your birthday or a special occasion!) I have never had a bad waiter/waitress in all of my visits here.  They are always friendly and extremely helpful.  Being more petite, I normally order the "city cut" as anything bigger is impossible for me to finish.  If I could, I would order one of the bigger cuts so I could get the free second slice, because it tastes that good, but I just can't fit that much food in my tummy!  While the meat is definitely the star of the meal, I have to admit I could come here for the salad alone.  It has to be one of the best salads I've ever eaten.  I'm not sure if it's the dressing, their seasoning or what, but it is just so tasty.  The warm bread they give you to munch on and the corn bread always taste good too.  As far as the sides go, I normally stick with the spinach and can go with either the baked potato (loaded with everything...love when they give me extra bacon) or mashed potatoes.   I've only once had room for dessert, and the strawberry shortcake was good, but I'll be honest...I was on the verge of a food coma, so anything probably would have tasted great.  Their drinks are also good.  I normally get a glass of wine, but when I'm in the mood I'll get a cocktail and haven't been disappointed yet! This is one of my favorite places to eat, and I will continue going back...and hopefully squeeze in a few extra visits this year!  :)</review>

	<review>This is a must try if you're in San Francisco! I can see why Anthony Bourdain picked this place 3 years ago!!! I would rate the food 4 stars but I have to bump it up to 5 stars for the whole WOW factor dining here! We were speechless throughout the whole dining experience here! All the wait staff seems to be very giddy and happy here. Wow, people that are actually happy with their job??? Our waitress was so cheerful and even joked around with us. We sat by a man and his son. Once he found out my friend was visiting from MA...he talked about Tadich Grill (restaurant my friend had lunch at). The son kept looking at us and asked..."how did you two meet?" It was hard not to chuckle looking at this cute, chubby,  7 year old inquisitive boy. We ordered The City Cut and The House of Prime Rib Cut (order this one if it's your 1st time here). We chose the mashed potatoes, cream of spinach, and yorkshire pudding (love this). It also comes with a pretty tasty salad with Thousand Island dressing. The sourdough bread was fresh and warm. We paired it with two glasses of Ravenswood Zin. I was a little worried my friend would miss his flight. So, I told him we should skip dessert. He persisted and said, "No, you don't come to House of Prime Rib and don't order a dessert!" So, we picked our top 3 choices and my friend told the waitress to surprise us with her favorite one (out of the 3). She came out with a cup of Expresso and the English Trifle (blueberries, blackberries, &amp; raspberries with Grand Marnier Creme Anglaise). I'm glad we had dessert. It was super yummy and hit the spot in my tummy!!! We even saw the waitress that served Anthony Bourdain. This place is popular. It was beginning to fill up by the time we arrived at 6pm. So, make sure you call ahead of time to make a reservation. If you want a great dining experience that will leave you satisfied and in awe...give this restaurant a try. The staff were really nice to us and great. Their happy attitude definitely makes you much more cheerful to eat here!!!</review>

	<review>I have been visiting the House of Prime Rib on major holidays over a course of several years.  It is truly an opportunity to travel back in time to 19th Century San  Francisco.  Of course, prime rib is the name of the game in this restaurant.  The customer has his choice of several cuts including the huge (hardy) King Henry Viii th cut.  I personally prefer the English cut which includes lean, thin slices.  All cuts are carved in a cart which is brought out on the floor and is in direct view of the customer.  Each meal includes a hand tossed salad, one's choice of potato (baked, mashed, etc.) and either creamed spinach and/or creamed corn.  The meal is supplemented with yorkshire pudding .  It is virtually impossible to leave here hungry.  For those who desire and/or  require more food, there are appetizers, drinks, and desserts available for a supplemental cost.  A visit to the House of Prime Rib is definitely a memorable journey back in time.  I highly recommend this restaurant.</review>

	<review>I love beef and I eat a lot of them. I can tell when restaurants are cutting corners when it comes to serving their steaks. Based on eating here twice, House of Prime Rib is definitely not one of them. TIPS: Do not eat too much bread or salad, especially the bread. Although its really yummy, stop yourself from doing something you'll regret. It's not as easy as it sounds. I speak from experience. But you would rather finish the meat.   The meat here is  juicy, tender, fresh, and fulfilling. Please don't request A1 steak sauce. Just let the natural flavor of the rib party in your mouth.You can choose to add horse radish or whatnot after you've fully tasted the meat as it was meant to be eaten. The choices of meat are simple. They are all prime ribs with the exception of a fish entrée. I never tried their fish so I can't recommend that, but for prime ribs, you're good to go with any size of your choice. The following are the different kinds of cuts: The City Cut House of Prime Rib Cut (recommended) The English Cut King Henry VIII Cut If you want to finish all your food including any side dishes that are provided, I would recommend you to go for the City Cut. But if you want a fulfilling meat dinner, get the House of Prime Rib Cut. Although you won't finish everything, you'll be satisfied. King Henry's cut is way too large for my taste (imagine a circle with a diameter of 6 inches). The English cut, which is meat sliced into thin pieces, may not carry enough flavor for some. When you're in doubt, just get the House of PR Cut. For side dishes, I usually get bake potatoes. You'll also be given Yorkshire pudding (unfortunately not sweet) and cream spinach, which you won't finish if you've eaten too much of the salad or bread. The price is well worth all that awesomeness you receive. Without a doubt this place gets 5/5!</review>

	<review>If it's good enough for the entire crew of linebackers from the SF 49ers, then it's good enough for me. My bf and I came here on a Sunday night while these friendly, huge men were around. It was great! It was very busy - people constantly coming in, waiting for their reservations, grabbing a seat at the bar... always a good sign. I def recommend making a reservation. Their menu is awesome. They basically serve only prime rib (unless you're coming to the house of prime rib for fish?) and all you do is choose which size you want - city cut (12 oz), house of prime rib cut (16 oz?), king cut (20 oz?) If you finish a house of prime rib cut or king cut, they'll serve you seconds if you can manage it! Their sides are delicious. The bread is warm, fresh with soft innards and a hardened crust. Their beet salad is AMAZING. Other great sides: cream of spinach, rice pudding (YES), and mashed or baked potato (fully loaded!) They also give you different "levels" of horseradish sauce--light (mixed with cream cheese), medium (mixed with mayo), spicy (pure horseradish). Now onto the MEAT: It was so good. MMM. Perfectly marbled with the right ratio of fat and meat. I ordered medium rare and it was perfect. I paired it with a red wine from Napa Valley and yeah, that felt really good. Service was very good. The waitress explained everything, checked on us regularly, and was pretty pro at serving the salad. It was definitely well worth it. Thanks to my bf who treated me to such a special meal :)</review>

	<review>Prime rib done well. If it's got the name "Prime Rib" in it, then the Prime Rib better be pretty damn good. House of Prime Rib did not disappoint. I got the English cut, the thinly sliced prime rib.  It was so good.  Every few bites, I could not help but to exclaim a few times how good it was!  Whenever I order meat I normally expect it to be tough and dry.  I would normally rely on slathering my food in A1 steak sauce or any side sauces, but prime rib here is just perfect!  The wine I had only enhanced the prime rib. The salad that came with the meal was pretty good.  I barely ate any of the side of creamed spinach because it tasted way to salty.  I wish I got the creamed corn instead. Service was very friendly.</review>

	<review>Hands down, HOPR is the best prime rib restaurant that I've been to. Not much to add to the other reviews except for what I recommend: 1. Start off with a Dirty Grey Goose Martini. They give you the shaker to refill your martini glass so you basically get two martini's for the price of one. 2. Order the English Cut and get it RARE. Rare is the *only* way to order prime rib. If you'd like it cooked more, just ask for more au jus and just dip it into the au jus until its cooked to your liking. The English Cut soaks up more of the au jus so its a lot more flavorful. Use the real deal horse radish if you can take the heat. 3. You can ask for both creamed spinach and creamed corn and they'll give you both. 4. If you like corn bread, make sure you ask for it at the start of dinner. For some reason, they don't always automatically serve it to you. 5. If you're still hungry....ask for a second serving of food. Very good value for a delicious meal.</review>

	<review>I have been coming here for about 20 years and I count down to the days/hours until my next visit. Majority of the times, the food is as good as I remember when, but there are some off days. My favorite cut is the house cut with mashed potatoes &amp; gravy, and the BEST creamed spinach I ever had. The yorkshire pudding is light and delicious when you dip it in th au jus, but my favorite is their PINK creamed horseradish (you have to ask for it). It is a mixture of tabasco and creamed horseradish, I usually add some of the extra spicy horseradish to it. It sooo... good that I can eat it alone. Also, on weekends you will see this older little gentlemen named Joe and he is the sweetest man you ever meet. He has been there since I was a kid and probably longer.</review>

	<review>My boyfriend and I were in town for the weekend, and called to make a reservation. The lady that answered said it was full, but they save some tables for walk ins. We thought we'd take our chances. We heard such wonderful things about the resturant. We get there and the host says it's about a hour to hour and a half wait. We decided to wait in there awesome waiting room with plenty of seating and flatscreen tv. We ordered Lemon drops, that came in a shaker. The waitress comes 15 minutes later to let us know our table was ready...awesome! OMG! The prime rib was amazing! It also came with an amazing salad and side of either garlic mash or fully loaded baked potatoe. The waitress was friendly and on top of things, and our food came in a timely manner. She recommended a delicious wine to go with our meat. We didn't have anything to complain about....The overall experience was amazing!</review>

	<review>i normally don't give 5 star reviews unless its a really good restaurant. i have been here numerous times and every time i come, i have a great experience. if you want to eat here you have to make a reservation few weeks in advance, they take walk ins but the wait is usually over an hour i heard. the menu is so simple but the food is excellent. first they serve you bread with butter, it tastes so good, sometimes i ask for more. then you get salad, i like watching them prepare the salad in front of you. finally the prime rib, its prob the best prime rib i've had considering it being very affordable. you also get a choice of baked or mashed potatoes and cream of corn or spinach . the best part is they ask if you want seconds, but only if you finish first and you can't take it home. i am getting hungry just talking about it, need to stop now...</review>

	<review>We had out of town guests so thought we'd try this place since it was on one of 100 things to do list in 2010 (put out by 7x7) Reservation was for 8:30pm and the place was packed! We were seated promptly. I love how simple the menu is - you just choose your meat and that is the price you pay for the meat and the 3 sides (salad, potato and vege) Yelpers said that the portions were big so we decided to split the King VIII Rib per couple.  (you pay $7.95 split fee to have all the sides) I don't know if I was simply hungry or whether it is really good - but their corn bread was REALLY good! Salad tossing by the table was fun to watch. Meat was juicy! Baked potato was hot and yummy with sour cream &amp; bacon bits. Creamed spinach (though I wouldn't really say was healthy) was good too. I don't usually order "bottled" water because I can't justify $10+  for a bottle of water so was worried when we got to our 3rd bottle of water - but we weren't charged for water so I assume water is included with the meal - which was a nice touch. There were at least 10 happy birthdays that were sung in 2 hours that we were there - I'm not sure if it's just a popular birthday restaurant OR whether there is a special deal for birthday person (later we found out that the birthday person gets a free scoop of ice cream) but it was interesting to see so many people having real (and maybe fake) birthdays. I give them 10 stars for service - one of our guests left his iPAD at the table and the waiter ran out after us (we had already walked about a block out) to give us the iPad. Food itself was good but probably not the healthiest meal you can get. We'll definitely be back when we have out of towners for an interesting night out. (we had no stomach for dessert after our meals)</review>

	<review>How do I love thee..Let me count the ways...#1 Great service #2 Amazing cocktails #3 Creamed Corn #4 Yorkshire pudding #5 Prime rib #6...Okay okay you get the point I love this place, I've been coming here since I was a little girl and the owner and wait staff have always come around to each table to check and make sure things are going well and you have all that you need. The bartender is always super friendly and def. has a way with a shaker! (made one heck of a gimlet for me) Even the guys at the valet are sweethearts and always very professional and quick. But lets get down to brass tacks here; the beef! Out comes the carver who  slices your meat for you right in front of you to your exact order, I'm pretty sure I'm in love with him by the way ! ha ha ! Seriously though, the meat is always done perfectly and if you finish the large cut and want more they will in fact bring you more. Although I'm pretty sure you'll walk out to the beat of your arteries clogging!!!! This last Sunday we took my dad there for his birthday and after a perfectly devine meal the waiter suggested desert. I mean at this point we had already gone up a size in clothing so why not just seal the deal with something sweet. Their fantasy cake is a beautiful chocolate piece of art work, their sorbets are delicious, but what really took my breath away was the tiramisu. The waiter suggested it saying it was his favorite and I decided to go with it. I've had tiramisu in Italy and with every bite I was brought right back to my street side cafe in Florence. House of Prime rib holds many beautiful family memories for me and in a way every time I go back there I feel like I'm home. So thank you House of Prime Rib for yet another memorable evening.</review>

	<review>So, I REALLY ought to be ashamed of myself.  An SF native, who for 24 years has never eaten at HOPR - but hey, I finally made it!   To top off the best birthday weekend I've EVER had, I was taken to a fancy dinner at the House of Prime Rib.  I'm such a lucky dog. =)   Let's take it from the top: [+] The bread was good, noteworthy even.  Fresh and soft inside, but crispy on the outside.  I tried not to eat too much because I wanted to save room.... but... fluffy and crunchy.. and warm.. I couldn't resist! [+] The salad was GREAT.  The servers spin the salad bowls in ice water as they toss everything together with dressing and then serve it to you.  HOW COOL IS THAT!  And for the record, I normally don't care for beets, but that salad was chock-full of beets and so tasty.   [+] The prime rib was unbelievably tender and just melt-in-your-mouth scrumptious.   I got the English Cut (see picture) medium rare and it was cooked PERFECTLY.  I was worried that it wouldn't be rare enough for me, but the chef must read minds.  This place is everything that I've heard about and MORE.  This is definitely a winner over Broadway Prime and San Mateo Prime!   [+] The cornbread was freakin' shaped like corn.  I love silly details like that.  And by the way, the corn-shaped cornbread was simply delectable and came out piping hot. [+] The creamed corn tasted like, you guessed it, fresh corn!  It wasn't too mushy, and it was just sweet enough.   [+] The Ventana Gerwurtriminer went well with everything, and one bottle was perfect for two people. [-] The only thing I DIDN'T love was the creamed spinach.  It was reminiscent of olives for me, and I dislike olives with a vengeance.   The service?  Superb.  The decor?  Rustic.  The ambiance?  A nice, fancy, yet homey feel.  Will I be back?  Hell yes!  I love this place, and I'll try to make up for every year that I've missed out!    ;]</review>

	<review>I finally made it to the House of Prime Rib.  I gotta say, it was awesome.  The meal is HUGE.  To start off, the salad bowl was great.  The portion was large and the salad was not short of flavor.  A lot of dressing which I like.  I got the House of Prime Rib cut with mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.  Everything was awesome.  I did not like the yorkshire pudding bread thing, but hey, that is just me.  The medium spiced horseradish sauce with the prime rib was amazing.  I could go back anytime!  Be prepared to eat a lot of food</review>

	<review>Excellent experience - had a great meal.  We checked in early for our 9:30 reservation on a Sunday night - it was packed.  They told us it would be about 5-10 minutes and invited us to wait in the lounge.  The servers in the lounge are very attentive. Unfortunately, 5-10 minutes turned into 20 minutes.  We checked on our reservation and were told we were next.  About 10-15 minutes later, we were finally seated.  After we sat down, the maitre d came by to apologize for the wait and offered a complimentary drink.  That was very classy and we appreciated the gesture. The food was amazing and our server was great.  We had the English cut (thinner cuts) and the King Henry (huge cut).  The salad, warm bread, and sides were excellent.  I preferred the creamed corn over the creamed spinach.  The prime rib was expertly prepared and so juicy.  I found the Yorkshire pudding pretty uninspiring.  It just got really salty when it soaked up the au jus, but it was fun to try.  We were too stuffed to order dessert, but I definitely want to go back and will attempt to save room for it next time. I had a great time and will definitely bring my carnivorous friends.</review>

	<review>Service was excellent.  You get a show at the table with the salad spinning.  Those knives are dangerous.   I wonder has anyone grabbed and slipped one into their purse?  You get a choice of complimentary water, how posh!  It seems like everyone was having a birthday!  It's just a treat to eat here and you feel welcomed.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting, like being in a cozy chateau somewhere.  I loved the tray of horseradish.  Try the hottest; it has a good kick!  The tiramisu was excellent, not too sweet.  Light enough to compliment the meal.  Yes, everybody at our table had a doggy bag!  If you don't like bacon, don't order the creamy spinach.  Of course, the prime rib was tender, why else would you be here.  This is the carnivore's heaven.</review>

	<review>This place is so amazing.  Finally got to try it when my friends brought me here for my birthday.  Besides having one of the BEST dry martinis (seriously), the food is simply delicious.  Great cuts of meat I tell you, GREAT!  Along with some savory sides (i liked the potato), the meat is juicy and tender.  It' arguable if it's as good as those high end restaurant steakhouses, and you're also not paying as much.   HOPR is one of those places you have to go to....and it's one of those places that will satisfy a lot of different occasions.  The atmosphere is formal but very relaxed.  But definitely if you're into meat and want a good place to go with family and/or friends, go here.</review>

	<review>The House of Prime Rib is a SF classic, you have to come here if you're visiting SF. We had a guest from out of town, so we made sure a meal at House of Prime Rib was in line. As we walked in to the restaurant, we saw that each dining room has its own cart of the prime rib roast, and a man carving it onto plates. OOooh.... the smell is amazing and it instantly jump start your hungry mode. Man, do I have to wait to place our order with the waiter, and wait? Can I just go up to the cart and get my food already? That was what I was thinking. Ok, it is a sit down restaurant, not buffet, in case I gave you the wrong impression. It is the table side presentation that they offer. After picking a bottle of red wine, and placing all our orders, the journey begun. Our waiter brought out a big bowl of salad and toss and spin it on our table side. We each got a giant plate of salad, almost the size of an entree elsewhere. Very good salad but save room for your entree!! and maybe dessert if you can resist not eating so much! I am going to fast forward to when the prime rib arrived. It was on a large plate with au jus on the bottom, creamed spinach (or creamed corn) and mashed potatoes (or baked potatoes for some of you). Ooohh , took my first bite of the prime rib and it melts in my mouth. It was so goood!!! So good!!! I am hungry now thinking about it.... Oh don't forget the yorkshire pudding that comes with your meal too, I just love it and can't get enough of it!!! Yummm.....my meal was delicious and so tasty. I noticed that most of the tables in our room were celebrating birthdays. They do bring out some dessert for the birthday person and sing the song. They also take a picture of your party with the polaroid camera for you, which I thought was very nice, even though we didn't get that since we weren't celebrating any birthdays.  What a great place for beef and birthdays!</review>

	<review>perfect 5 stars in my book, only downside?? the wait. about an hour wait on a friday night with a reservation. =( the manager (i dont remember his name) was really nice and accommodating and comped our desserts for our super long wait. he came over personally and apologized, reminded the server that our desserts should be comped, and even remembered us at the end of the night to wish us a safe trip home. the lady at the bar (which i also didnt catch the name of) was very nice also. our server, was excellent and made the entire night a wonderful experience. english cut: $38 -four thinly sliced pieces of prime rib. mine was a bit dry and chewy. but was a lot better with the au jou and mild horse radish. =) my second slice was MUCH better. tender, juicy, wonderful. if i werent so full, i would have gone for THIRDS! king henry cut: $40 -huge, hunkin' slab of steak. about 16oz. i tried some and his steak was much more tender and juicy than my english cut. mashed potatoes w/ gravy: yum baked potato with everything on it: i wouldnt try it again. creamed spinach: not a big fan of spinach, but i wouldnt have known it was spinach. had bits of bacon in it! creamed corn: just ok salad: DELICIOUS! strawberry shortcake: $8, also delicious fantasy cake: $8, magnificent! i wish we ordered two of these instead! chocolate was light and airy, perfect texture with the cheesecake!</review>

	<review>One of my TOP favorite restaurants.   I love the simple menu (I'm always really undecisive because I want to try EVERYTHING)  You got several choices of cuts for prime ribs (I wouldn't order anything else) then it comes with fresh bread and butter, generous sized salad, choice of baked or mashed potatoes (both equilly delicious), creamed spinach or creamed corn (get the creamed spinach, TRUST ME!) and yorkshire pudding.   I usually get the House Cut (King Henry is for the King Sized Appetite) The prime rib is always so tender and juicy!  The Au Jus is out of this world!  The service is extremely friendly everytime we go.   If you still haven't tried this place, I demand you to set a reservation right now! You won't regret it! FOOD - 5 Oh sooo goood! SERVICE - 5 Can't get any better then this DECOR - Very Elegant</review>

	<review>WOW!!  House of Prime Rib was awesome.  My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary, and decided to try House of Prime Rib.  We were here once before, but the wait was so long, and a friend of ours said Harris' was better.  So never actually sat down to eat here, until now.  And let me say, we were pretty impressed. The food was wonderful here.  First the bread came out, piping hot.  And who doesn't love fresh bread?  I think we could have eaten 5 loaves if we wanted to, but knew to expect a lot of food from the reviews on here, that we stuck with just half.  Next was the salad course.  My husband and I prefer ceasar over any salad, but were definitely not let down by this salad.  The beets were a great complement to the salad dressing, which tasted like a combo of thousand island and something else.  Whatever that something else was, it sure did make the salad taste like one of the best salads out there!  Next course was the prime rib, and I have to say, it was DE-LI-CIOUS!!  The meat was so tender, it almost melted in my mouth.  YUMMY!!!  The last part of the meal was dessert, and we ordered the trifle.  Nothing special about this, but don't have any bad comments either. The service at this restaurant was also great.  Our server always made sure we were doing well, recommended wine for us, and said if we didn't like it, we could always change it for something else.  He always made us feel comfortable, with that personable attitude.  Great great service. If you are looking for great prime rib, and more prime rib for the buck, this is the place to go.  My husband and I have tried so many different places, including Lawrys and Morton's, but for the price you pay, you definitely can't go wrong here.  We loved it, and will definitely come back in the near future.  I'm craving it already just writing this!!!</review>

	<review>For my belated birthday my friend John took me here this past Friday. House of Prime Rib, I love you with a passion! Yes, you are simply the best. How simple you are, yet so simply freaking perfect! The name says it all. They've mastered the craft of prime rib, and offer you four different cuts/sizes. I recommend ordering the King Henry Cut, since its only four bucks more compared to the smaller cut. Towards the end of the meal, you can even get a second serving of prime rib for free! That's right, for FREE! :) Included with the prime rib is a salad prepared at your table, choice of mashed or baked potato, and creamed corn or creamed spinach. Food (5 stars):     For starters you get served fresh and tasty sourdough bread that is still very warm and soft on the inside.  Just don't load up on too much bread or else you will get full before for the main course is served. The salad here is also very good. (http://static2.px.yelp.c…) They prepare your salad right in front you as if you were at a Vegas show. The beats/radishes that they used helped made this salad amazing. I'm not the biggest salad fan, but it's enticing.  The prime rib was extremely tender, flavorful, juicy, and simply delicious! (http://static4.px.yelp.c…) This is easily the best prime rib I've ever had. The meat is like M&amp;Ms, it just melts in your mouth. The baked potato is also prepared right in front of you, and they do not skimp out on any of the condiments. The creamed corn and the creamed spinach are both excellent.  What I like about the creamed spinach is the pieces of bacon that is inside. OMG, so good! Service (5 stars): The service here is top notch and impeccable. I don't remember our waiter's name, but he was so on point.  He was very professional and extremely attentive.   Summary: Prime Rib at its finest! So mouth watery delicious that your heart will want to take up their offer for a second serving of prime rib, yet your stomach will beg for mercy. This song best describes how I feel about HOPR: Drake - Best I ever Had   "i say you the you the best you the you the best you the you the best you the you the best you the best i eva had best i eva had best i eva had"</review>

	<review>Can't...move. Must...stay...on...couch. This place was so good. English cut, medium rare. Mashed potatoes. Creamed spinach. Yorkshire pudding and salad with one of the best dressing I have ever tasted in my ENTIRE life! Waitress was super friendly and the environment was so nice and sophisticated but easy-going at the same time. Please, serve me more delicious thin slices of prime rib, more and more and more! Yorkshire pudding was probably my favorite side - like some kind of sweet bread or something...I have no idea. But really, EVERYTHING was top notch. Waitress comes by: like some dessert? Oh gosh, I guess I'll take a look. One look. I'm keeling over. Want...dessert. Stomach says no. But it looks so good! Then legs can't move. Yeah, it's time to leave but I'll be back oh prime rib, you.</review>

	<review>My all time favorite restaurant!!!!!!!!! Been going here since I was 10 years old. I always order the City Cut. Pretty good with price considering the fact that it comes with sides (unlike Ruth's Chris down the street). The salad is amazing! I always make sure I save some for later. The bread is fresh and hot out of the oven. They baked potato is always perfect. Staff is friendly. Make sure you make reservations. This place gets packed! Also, keep in mind, even if you make reservations, you still wait about 30 mins +/- but they have a lounge area with a TV and cocktail servers. Helps bring up your appetite anyways.</review>

	<review>I popped my HOPR cherry last night... It was so worth it. Went last night with Vince K. and another friend of ours. They have a reputation for eating like heffers, so I half-expected them to take home seconds!!! They couldn't do it this time, but, there's always next time. The salad was awesome and served in HEAPING portions. I don't think I've ever eaten beets before -- I tend to avoid them -- but this time, I just went with it, and it was delicious. Best dinner salad I've had in a long, long time, and I ate nearly the whole plate! I ordered the City Cut, which was cooked to perfection -- tender and flavorful, and served with Yorkshire pudding (a new favorite... I totally fell i love with it. I love squishy breads), a baked potato (or mashed, if you choose), and cream spinach. Everything was PERFECT. A waiter was passing out jalapeno cornbread, so we got in on some of that action too. It was quite good, soft on the inside and a little bit crispy on the outside, and just enough jalapeno to not overpower anything. There was so much food. I don't think I've ever devoured that much food so quickly... EVER. But it was SO GOOD. I'm definitely coming back again and again and again...</review>

	<review>Consistency is the key I always say. Same dining and food experienced everytime I come here. I love cow. Everything is good here. Even the salad. The only salad I eat is ceaser but now its ceaser and house of prime rib salad. I usually ask for bones after dinner for my pit bull and they just give them to me. Even my dog loves this place and she never been here. I like how the owner always walks around and asks "is everything okay"make sure everything is good. At least you  know he cares. Now thats customer service. We got the owner walking around while he should be at home counting his cash flow. Great service. Great food. Great prices. A+</review>

	<review>My favorite favorite place in SF.  I totally miss it!!!  Best mashed potato in the world.  I used to polish off King Henry cut and an extra slice...I dunno how I did it.  Ask for extra au jus.  Few of my friends are hooked on English Cut but I still prefer the big cut.  I used to go here at least once every other month :)  If you are in SF, go there and eat there.  Only sad part is you will not find better prime rib any where else.  Lowry's come close and I think their salad taste better but this place is still my #1.  I wish I was in SF right now.  YUM!!!</review>

	<review>WHATUP! DO you want to experience English atmosphere without traveling there? THEN COME HERE for a dinner, also, bring $40 if you want to have enough for a hearty meal. I was actually brought here by 2 friends for a birthday. Let's cut to the chase. Environment: When you walk in, there's dim lighting, but not too dim that you can't see the food. Where I sat, there was leather seating and the dinner table was set with many utensils as you would expect a nice restaurant to set them. You will see plenty of wines stacked, and aging meat in another part of the restaurant. FOOD: The best partttt baby! House of Prime Rib Cut: When they say prime rib melts in your mouth, it doesn't actually melt like butter, but it sure does come pretty close. If you're adventurous, eat the marbling fat, but not the huge chunks. The fat's what makes the meat tasty. After chewing, closing your eyes smiling while holding your fork and knife, you realize, YES this meat has been aged and marinaded to perfection. The best prime rib I've had thus far. Fresh Cream of Radish Sauce: GET IT, pairs up well with the meat. Shall we say, English wasabi with a kick to it? haha Mashed Potatoes: I recommend this because it's placed next to the prime rib and can soak up the juices that fall down from the meat. It also, was excellent, carefully hand-mashed potatoes. Not what you expect from a normal restaurant. You can taste the butter as well! Creamed Spinach: This doesn't pair up with the meal as well, but the bits of bacon definitely add a new twist to it. It does have the right proportions of spinach and cream, not too creamy, not too much spinach. Yes come here, on a date, or with a family. Be ready to relax, have fun, and have great conversation because it's not just a place to sit down and leave. : )</review>

	<review>This place is number one in any meat lovers heart. Been going here since I was born and would never imagine going anywhere else for a quality meal. The salad dressing is addicting so I always take some bottles to go and as always if your still hungry after the king cut, the will gladly serve you another one. Great sides and amazing bread! 11 out of 10!</review>

	<review>we were really lucky to be able to get a sunday, 5 pm dinner reservation only 3 days before our dinner.  that's more rare than a blue moon! service was excellent, as it has been for years!  we were there for a birthday and i have absolutely nothing bad to say about the service or the food!  the server was a little bit forgetful, but the host really made up for it and frequently came around asking if we needed anything. i came in with a cake and told the host we'd need it served after dinner.  there was a $4/person dessert fee if you wanted to serve your own cake.  since it was my brother's dirty 30, i didn't mind.  in the end, i think my brother told the host he worked for the city (hoping a discount, because he's gotten it before when dining with co-workers), but we didn't get one.  we did get the dessert fee waived though!  the host was really nice and the servers came out and sang happy birthday too.  it was a good dinner.</review>

	<review>So I was there with my company for a dinner outing.  I've been here before, so I already knew what to expect.  I chose the English cut, because I was told that it has more flavor.  I really like the King cut, cause I love prime rib.  I have to admit, the English cut is pretty tasty, but I think I will stick with the King cut.  The creamed spinach is wonderful, and the mash potatoes are creamy.  Salad is spectacular.  I would love to go here again.</review>

	<review>This is some of the best Prime Rib I have EVER had. The portions are quite large - I had the The City Cut and it was more than enough food even though it said it was a "smaller cut". I had it done medium and it was PERFECT! The sides are generous and yummy and the bread was so good! We were early for our reservations so we sat in the bar and had some drinks. The waitress was super nice and the drinks were good.</review>

	<review>This prime rib rocks!  And that's not a light statement considered I grew up in Chicago and I've had my fair share of beef.  Juicy, tasty fresh beef with just the right au jus on it.  I've been here quite a few times and I'm always satisfied with the prime rib. It's just fun watching how they pour the salad dressing in the salad bowl while spinning it.  Yorkshire pudding is just not my cup of tea.  I only get wine by the glass and it's never great or bad.  No room for dessert for sure.   Dark decor but not really very romantic since it's so loud. The wait is horrendous.  I waited for over an hour one time on a week night even with a reservation.  While you're waiting at the sitting area, they serve you jars of nuts.  Try not to eat it as you want every bit of stomach room for that prime rib.  They City Cut is more than enough but if you want the House of Prime Rib Cut or even the King Henry VIII, go for it and I salute you.  Remember, Henry VIII was triple the size of Jonathan Rhys Meyers in The Tudors.</review>

	<review>I came here for my sisters birthday with some of her friends tonight. The bread was good, the mashed potatoes and spinach was alright, and the English cut prime rib was very good. The meat was very tender, which made it a pleasant dinner for me. It ended up being around $50 a person with only a glass of water as a drink. Not bad.</review>

	<review>Obviously since the name of the place includes Prime Rib, they must try and have the best prime rib around. Thankfully, they do. House of Prime Rib has by far the best prime rib in California, yes i said California.   The service is pretty good, usually even the bus boys well help you with something if you ask them. One thing that makes this place even better is the history. The manager walks around and talks to the people, and he once told me about all the famous people that has ate there. The House of Prime Rib is a fancy place that is well worth the money. And, for dessert, try the cheesecake.</review>

	<review>My friends took me here for my birthday (group of five).  We had to wait even though we had a reservation (which several people warned me before hand, so it wasn't a surprise).   They are really strict on having all persons in your party PRESENT when your host/hostess is ready to seat you.  After 20 minutes of waiting, our hostess came by while me and my friend were in the restroom (the restroom had only two stalls).  The hostess had to skip us over.  That got on our nerves, but we were able to be seated after an additional 20 minutes. The service was EXCELLENT.  We ordered a bottle of wine and I guess the protocol is for the server to show you the wine and pour a bit it in a glass for you to smell and taste it (I'm not a wine enthusiast, so this practice kind of surprised me). The salad was the best I've ever had.  I wanted to consume the whole thing, but I wanted to save room for the prime rib.  The dressing was a flavorful vinegrette and the salad had bits of beets in it that surprisingling was very good! My rare prime rib came with the spinach and yorkshire pudding.  The prime rib was excellent!  Juicy and flavorful, cut right in front of you!  I ate the whole thing.</review>

	<review>I came here for Valentine's Day and I'm still full.  We started off at the bar and got martinis.  Much like Blondie's they give you your filled martini glass plus another cup with the rest of the martini, so.....you get a lot.  This place is perfect for a group (we had 10) because the menu is so simple.  You're pretty much getting the prime rib dinner because that's really all they have (or you can get fish, but why would you even go to a restaurant called The House of Prime Rib and get fish?  That's just stupid.)  Your meal comes with your preferred cut of prime rib, a salad, mashed potatoes or a baked potato, cream corn or creamed spinach, and yorkshire pudding (which is like a pastry, fluffy bread that tastes a little eggy.)  They also have an extensive wine list with a lot of great wines.  Overall, I had a wonderful experience here and I would venture back.  The food was tasty, the price just right, and the service friendly.  If this was The House of Filet Mignon, it would get 5 stars.</review>

	<review>It was my first time visiting with all the hype from my friends. The food was great, and service is good. Not a romantic place to go, but definitely with a group of friends. The place is a little dated, but it is nice to stll get that SF vibe. Definitely go with an empty stomach, they fill you up quite well. And, if your still not full they'll give you another small piece of prime rib. Enjoy...</review>

	<review>Love love this place. My boyfriend and I have been coming here for 8 years. Every time we try and bring more people. We come usually once or twice a year. This year we came for Valentine's Day with 2 other couples. The food is great. I love everything from the salad (great dressing) to the wonderful piece of prime rib that comes out of that beautiful silver cart. I even love the bar nuts to snack on when we are waiting for our table. I also really enjoy their lemon drop! I will be going again and hopefully its before next Valentine's day!</review>

	<review>Came here with the BF and a few of our close friends for our NYE dinner. Definitely go with the valet - so much quicker and saves you the stress from searching for street parking in the busy city. It's a nice, somewhat classy place, but nothing too formal. Prices were pretty reasonable - especially for the amount of food that is served with your meal and it's A LOT. They start you off with a deliciously prepared salad - comes with lots of greens and veggies covered in a tasty dressing similar to thousand island but with an extra kick. For the prime rib, there are 4-5 different cuts of meat you can choose from. The Chef then rolls a cart out with the prime rib and slices the meat right in front of your table. Pretty neat experience I'd say. The boyfriend chose the English Cut and I had the House of Prime Rib cut. Both came out juicy, tender, and cooked just the way we love it - medium rare! Bloody good stuff! Mmmmmm. The meal came with a variety of sides to choose from as well. We had steamed spinach and a baked potato. Everything was more than enough to fill us up for the night. They even offer seconds if you wanted to stuff yourself with more of their tender prime rib. None of us managed to do so - we were just hoping to finish what was on our plates. Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience. Service was great and the prime rib was delicous! Definitely a nice dinner to kick off the new year!</review>

	<review>Prime rib coma...expect it after coming here!  The prime rib is perfectly cooked, tender and delicious.  The sides aren't even necessary, but are rather tasty.  I particularly enjoyed the creamed spinach, perfect pair with the prime rib.  The yorkshire pudding is surprisingly tasty with the prime rib jus.   I really like the salad that comes with the meal.  It's a mountain of a dish with what seems like a thousand island dressing with a twist (more acidic maybe).  I randomly crave that salad.   Their Manhattans are on point!  I'm a new fan of them.   Tip: if ur a big eater they offer seconds! My bf seriously inhaled his large cut and our waiter brought him a couple of thinner slices of prime rib.  I'm still in disbelief that he ate it all! ALL!   Service is excellent, and the waiters have great personality!  Can't wait to return with a huge appetite!</review>

	<review>The food was very good but we were served over an hour after our reservations. At that point neither of us was hungry, but the waiter efficiently packed up our food. Waiting for a table, even with reservations, was a madhouse and disorganized. The tables were close to each other.</review>

	<review>I love the HOPR but after dec 5 dinner I would hesitate going back. the place was very loud and the server rushed us to order like they wanted us to eat and leave in one hour. The server for the tables next to us was screaming to tell her guests the specials and the menu. As usual the prime rib was delicious but everyone who had the creamed spinach said it was not as good as usual; the creamed corn tasted like it just came out of the can. I had pecan pie and it was not very good. the guests with me had the creme broulee and said it was good. the place was packed but the food and dining experience was not up to the old House of Prime Rib that we knew/ we all agreed to go to Harris or Ruth Chris before New Years as we always had a good experience and the venues were much quieter.</review>

	<review>I called today to buy my friend a gift certificate.  They were closed but not the office as a man answered the phone.  I asked if I could come by to purchase the gift certificate.  He said not until they were open. Other than this afternoon, I could not come by, so I offered to pay for it over the phone with my credit card and then come by and call when I was there for someone to just run it down to the door for me.  That is an easy enough way to close a sale, especially when offered by the customer. He declined my offer and I bought a gift elsewhere.  This is very annoying service and not smart business to turn away someone that wants to give their money to you. I am not giving a 1 star--even though the service displayed here deserves it--because the food is outstanding.</review>

	<review>My husband and I went here for our anniversary this weekend. We have had reservations since August. We on time for our reservation and had to wait at the bar for 30 minutes until we were seated. The front of the restaurant was really loud too - and we could barely hear each other while we were waiting by the bar. Once our table was ready, we were lead to the back of the restaurant where it was a little quieter, but still pretty loud. Dinner came, it was OK - good piece of meat. My husband got the king cut and I got the city cut. Very tasty and tender. The meat carving station though was sitting next to us the entire time. So we saw that our meat had been sitting there a while before it was served to us. I had creamed spinach and my husband got the corn. He said the corn was awful. My spinach was good though. The service was nothing special. Not too attentive and it took a while to get refills. Overall, I would save my money for somewhere else. Not worth the trouble or price.</review>

	<review>3.5 stars Honestly, I'm a sucker for these type of restaurants.  Kind of scary looking inside...every table with more than 4 people is piss drunk. Kinda like those Claim Jumpers.... oh you're ordering, well here's a SHITLOAD OF FOOD. And honestly it isn't bad. I've gone twice, and thought this slab of meat wasn't as tasty as the last time... but it was good. Except for the acrid smell of wine-off since my beligerent buddy decided to spill the wine all over his shirt. The Yorkshire pudding is really good too... but this time around, i didn't get enough jus to spread the love... so it kinda tasted bland..</review>

	<review>Over the last few years, I've only come here a handful of times...but they're pretty consistent. I recently came here with some friends and it was pretty much the same. We came as a group of 3 - original reservation was for 4, but we had one drop out. Boo. They seated us quite promptly. The reservation we had to make over a month in advance! But...I guess that's what happens when you want to go on a holiday-ish (new years day). For an indecisive person like me, the menu is pretty awesome. You choose a cut, cooking style, potato style, corn or spinach, and get Yorkshire pudding.  Done. No need to pour endlessly over the menu! I don't think there's much unique about it. This last time I went, I requested a mid-rare steak, and it came pretty rare. With 2 bones attached. I felt like a monster eating it!! Though I'm not sure if that's a plus or minus. More meat (yay!) but not my requested cook style (boo). It was also SUPER fatty. I cut out what felt like an ounce of fat from the sides. I guess when its cooked to rare, you can't get the fat out. Then again, my friends got well done and they cut out a lot of fat too. Hurm...See photo of my cut and please let me know if I'm insane and that IS considered mid-rare. It was just so red and bloody... http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The waiters were super attentive and nice, so it's really a 3.5 stars. I bump down because for the price, I kind of expect more...</review>

	<review>Many people were hype up about this place so I decided to give this place a try. Unfortunately, I wasn't a great fan of this place. It is decent meat but I wouldn't crave for this place. I am a very picky eater as I have went to many nice and bad restaurants before. The side dishes were pretty good and I would say it is plentiful. If your the type that wants big portion of food for an okay price, this is the place to go. I would say perhaps 50$ per head. the service was friendly and nice</review>

	<review>Honestly speaking, this place serves good prime rib.  Is it the best I ever had, probably not.  They don't really season it much IMO, leaving a very natural flavor to the meat.  This is neither good or bad, just preference. The creamed spinach and Yorkshire pudding are excellent, and so is the baked potato. The King Henry cut is nice, thick, juicy and really full of nice fat.  The best part is going caveman on the bone and just cleaning up all that meat off it! I would come back here for the prime rib, but I can't really say that all roads to the search for the best prime rib ends here.  It is a great palce to go with a group. It does get really loud, so proabably not the best place to go for an intimate, quiet date.</review>

	<review>Prime rib was good but not great. I enjoyed the prime rib at Sundance steakhouse in Palo Alto a lot more. The salad was just ok. It tasted like it had a thousand island dressing. Good thing is they give second servings if you finish your first serving. The sides of spinach and mash were good but not great.  Great service overall. Probably would not go back.</review>

	<review>Over-hyped once in a while/special occasion dinner. You've heard of hurry-up-and-wait?  Well this place is it's not as well known yet equally annoying brother, wait-then-GTFO Bar: No beer on tap.  Ok, my first impression was to not take them very seriously. Seated: Streamlined menu, meat on one side, sides on another, order taken.  Bread is hot, don't cut your hand.  Wait some, then the salad show. Delicious bacon strips.  Yea they are beets, but I prefer bacon strips. Why do I have a crap ton of salad?  Dried up cornbread(?) shank.  Needs butter...butter not helping.  Is that zeppelin parked near our table with the one ticket sticking out of the top for us? Why are we waiting so long for beef that is already cooked? Its been there for at least 15 minutes.  Waiter folds napkins diligently.  I walk to the restroom, nice bed sheet curtain.   Guess what, that IS our zeppelin.  Dude was off salsa dancing down the street or something.  BEEF IS HERE.  Spinach...soft...doesn't taste like much.  Baked potato, sour cream, can't go wrong.  Have to use the restroom again.  After drinking and asking for Becks, I am brought an Amstel Light.  How one hears one, yet brings another perplexes me.  Beef is inhaled, restroom again. So we had less than 10 minutes to eat by my calculation?  As one of our party put it, its like Disneyland, wait for hours, and have a great 90 seconds.  They are already bringing the to-go boxes.  No asking if i wanted another slice.   Being swarmed by staff.  GTFO.  Did they ask if we wanted dessert?  I understand its busy, but don't take it out on us.  Have Senor Salsa slice the beef faster, profits would skyrocket.</review>

	<review>We came here for a birthday dinner, the night the Giants was in the WS , game 3. We first circled around for parking, noting that it was dinner hour, so there wasn't many available. We finally settle for valet parking ($9 - minus half a star - seriously, who pays for parking?) and then lounge around with Giants fans. Our reservation was at 8 and was told to notify them when the whole party was there. Everyone was on time, but unfortunately, they were 30ish minutes behind. (minus an half star...or maybe not) But that didn't' matter, the Giants won the game (!) when our table was called. So we settle in and I'm told that you get a second piece of steak if you if finished the first one. I didn't pay much attention, but apparently, it only applies to certain meals and you can not take the second piece home. Since I don't eat beef, I settle with the salmon with asparagus (which I sub for spinach) and mash potato. The first thing that came out was the sour dough bread, then the corn bread, then the salad (which is like a meal) and then the entree, served with bread pudding. Everything looked very fresh. The sour dough tasted good. Fresh right? No one particularly liked the corn bread. The salad was huge! It came out chilled, with a chilled fork. The waiter mixed their "house" dressing right in front of us. It was tad bit salty for me but it wasn't bad. The entree...Everyone seems pleased with their entree but me. My salmon (which I told them raw, very raw) came out medium well, and the size of the salmon was 1/3 of everyone's steak. The price is roughly the same. The spinach wasn't tasty at all. The mash potatoes which was under salmon, was the only good tasty thing. Oh, the bread pudding was okay. Service was very good. (minus the wait for table) However, when we got the bill, we found out that the tiiramisu (which the wife picked, thinking it was complimentary) wasn't on the house for the birthday boy. Overall experience - A -Ok. Service was the only one that got the highest star. Paying for a parking to eating isn't my thing, especially if the food is only okay. (Even Alexander's fish was better!) 3 stars</review>

	<review>First off, this place is old school and expensive. We went here for a family dinner. The place has a bar where you can wait for your table. The drinks are good and strong and the pour is enough for two drinks, great deal, its like a two for one. The service is kind of rushed. It wasn't long before the waiter was asking what we wanted. Basically the question should be what size would you like your prime rib since that is the only thing( aside from one fish dish) that they serve. The meat is keep in the dinning area with a guy who cuts it to order, so it is served directly to you and not from the kitchen. The meat was good not great. The sides were basic as well. Nothing really stood out. The salad was good but a little too overdressed. As soon as we were done we were given a check. You get the impression that they need to turn over the tables quickly for the next guest. If I am paying $40 per person to eat, give me some time to eat.</review>

	<review>Went to House of Prime Ribs in mid-October, 2012 for a family birthday celebration. Haven't been there in maybe over 30 years and found this visit okay but not great. The dining room is noisy to have a comfortable conversation. The 'salad show' is all gimmicky; lots of salt &amp; pepper and dressing is pured onto some wilted-looking lettuce. The meat was good but I'd have liked the temperature to be warmer; the sides were disappointing: baked potato smothered in sour cream and chives, lacklustered creamed corn/cream spinich/Yorkshire pudding. Desserts: the bread pudding was pretty good, but I've had better creme brulee and tiramisu elsewhere. Maybe they've got the House of Prime Ribs experience down to a science, but that's also the problem. It feels like an assembly line/cookie cutter rote routine.</review>

	<review>The salad wasn't fresh, it was more on the wilted side and the corn bread was overcooked. What was really good was the prime rib.  Very tender and the Au Jus sauce really made the dish. We ordered the king cut which was good, but the cut wasn't as thick as expected.  Yes you get the bone but they seem to slice thinner as they get past the bone.  The creamed spinach wasn't that great either.  4 stars for the flavor and tenderness of the prime rib, 2 stars for everything else.</review>

	<review>My experience was decent.  Although the side dishes were good, they make you full before your prime rib is served.  Prime rib was good but the sauce was salty (I think it's just soy sauce).  We were seated right by the walk way where it was very loud and there were lots of traffic.  The waiters kept bumping against our table.</review>

	<review>I have been wanting to try this place FOREVER because of all of the people I know who rave about it. So I finally tried it.  And I don't need to try it again.  What is all the fuss about? We had reservations at 8 and were seated around 8:45.  As our entire party of 8 was there by 7:45 this was a little annoying. The place felt a little gimmicky.  I think the "big deal" is that they carve the prime rib for you right at the table from a super cool prime rib cart.  The atmosphere feels super outdated on the inside, and it was hot (we were uncomfortable for the majority of our meal) and LOUD.  Soooo loud. And here's the other thing:  There is no menu, really.  Everyone gets the same meal prepared the same way - whether you are 3 years old or a total foodie.  So (in my opinion) they serve to the lowest common denominator.  Everything was "good", but not "great" or unique.  And for what you get I'm not sure it's worth the pricetag. So here's what you get:  the best freshly baked bread I've ever had in a restaurant, salad (with beets and thousand island dressing - you have been warned!), prime rib cut one of four ways, creamed spinach or corn, yorkshire pudding (zero value add), and a baked potato or mashed potatoes with gravy.  Most everything was solid - but aside from the bread nothing was special. We brought our own wine and they were fine with it; charged a $20 corkage fee for the first 2 bottles, then $25 for our third. The service was - how do I say - enthusiastic?  See "gimmicky" remark above.  They were fairly attentive (though it did take us about an hour to get our food from the time we sat down), and definitely friendly.  But a little cheeseballs, if you get my drift. They had an amazing dessert menu - I tried the bread pudding and it was super rich and yummy.   I'd only go back if someone else was footing the bill.  All in all, I'm glad I tried it.</review>

	<review>Overall good but didn't wow me. I think if anything, the decor was the most interesting - almost like a 1960's feel inside. We had a sizable group and service was fine. It's kind of unique that your order choice is just prime rib - small, regular, or large sized...and cut thin if you'd like. There was a alternative fish option not on the menu. I got the petite prime rib cut and it was fine and filling. The sides were a little too basic - cream corn or cream spinach and mash potatoes or baked potato. I asked for regular steamed spinach and wasn't digging it. Maybe I just crave a little bit a variety! If you're a big meat-eater, it's a great place to go. Definitely about the quantity here. I was surprised that if you get at least the regular cut, if you're still hungry after it, they'll give you a thin courtesy slice to top you off.</review>

	<review>I was excited to try this place after hearing a lot of hype about their prime rib. I'm an avid fan of red meat, especially prime rib. There wasn't any street parking in front of the restaurant, so if you plan on driving here, you could either valet it or park a couple of blocks down. We managed to find parking relatively easily (by SF standards) in the residential neighborhood nearby. Timeline of our HOPR experience: Our reservation was made for 5:30 PM (opening time), and we arrive at 5:25 PM. When we checked in at the front to let them know we arrived, they were neither friendly nor rude...they were almost..indifferent. We didn't know where we were supposed to wait after checking in (hello?! you guys could've told us!)...there's a room to the left of the entrance where you can sit while waiting for your table. We never would've known this because we were never told where to go after checking in. Thank goodness we read a bunch of reviews on Yelp that informed us of this. We got called at around 5:30 PM...not a long wait at all. We barely sat down before our table was ready. Got seated at a small booth at the front of the restaurant. Our server came by and explained the menu. City (~8 oz): $36 HOPR (~12-13 oz): $39 English (? oz.): $39 King Henry (~15 oz): $41 Every meal comes with creamed spinach or creamed corn, sourdough bread, cornbread, mashed potatoes or baked potato, and salad. Our waiter then brought us water: choice of still water or sparkling water, no charge for either, and they bring you a giant glass bottleful to keep at your table. We put in our orders (HOPR, medium-rare and English, medium-well). After about 5 minutes, we got a giant ball of sourdough bread with a block of butter on the side. Honestly, the bread wasn't that great. The only good thing about it (in my opinion) is that it was hot and fresh. It tasted a bit too chewy and I would've liked the butter to be soft so I could spread it on my bread easier. Instead, the butter was almost straight out of the fridge, and wouldn't spread easily over my bread. 5 minutes later, we each get a piece of cornbread. The cornbread was about 1.5" x 5" big, and was surprisingly really good. Great consistency and flavor. Every now and then, someone comes by to pour our water for us even though the bottles were already at our table and we could've done it ourselves. We thought that was pretty nice of them! After about 10 minutes, our server comes back with salad. Ahh, real food at last! The salad arrived like so: the salad was in a bowl, and that bowl was in another bowl filled with ice; dressing was brought separately. The salad was tossed in front of us in a rather unnecessarily theatrical manner. First, our server spun the salad bowl in the ice bowl while grinding fresh black pepper into it. Then, he spun it another time while raising the cup of dressing above his head while pouring it. Lastly, he took a pair of tongs and tossed everything together. Needless to say, I felt that the salad would've tasted exactly the same way if the theatrical elements of steps 1 and 2 were omitted. Taste-wise, the salad definitely had too much dressing on it. It was swimming in dressing. Otherwise, it tasted good. Oh yeah, we also got a "chilled fork" to eat our salad with. Please. Like that makes much of a difference either. Unless that fork had magical dressing-subtracting powers, it was no different from any regular fork. Another 10 minutes later, our main entree was brought out. They cart around a stainless steel contraption that houses the prime ribs and the sides. In addition to the meat, we both ordered creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. The prime rib slices were cut at our table. My medium-rare HOPR cut was fortunately sizable, unfortunately lukewarm, and had a lot of fat on it. Still, that thing was one TASTY slice of prime rib. My food buddy's English cut was pretty much well done, despite ordering it medium-well. Boooo. The mashed potatoes were great...superrr mushy though. Creamed spinach was good, but nothing special. Our server came by every now and then to check on us, which was great. He was very friendly and attentive. I felt like I was being rushed through my meal. I was asked TWICE in a span of 5 minutes (literally) if I was ready to have my plate taken away. To be fair, they did apologize the second time, but I'm assuming this is because I gave a very firm "NO" and a look that said "You touch my meat, and I will stab your hand with my fork." :) After finishing our main entrees, our server brought us dessert menus. Everything is $8 except for ice cream ($6). We shared a creme brulee, which tasted great. Very creamy and light, good portion size. Our meal came out to be $93 without tip. Overall, food was excellent. Service, if averaged throughout the night, was subpar, unfortunately. Lower the prices, improve the service, and I'll come back for more, HOPR!</review>

	<review>Reservation was at 8pm, arrived at 7:20pm, got seated at 8pm exactly. House of prime rib is very overrated. Comes with the option of complimentary sparkling or still water. We ordered the a la carte of the Kings Cut. Tasted average, nothing spectacular or had any wow characteristics about it. The sides, creamed spinach, cream corn, baked potato and the yorkshire pudding were okay, nothing to rave about. Two stars for the taste, prime rib was not even flavorful. Star for the evening goes out to our amazing server Todd! He was accommodating and attentive, personable, and very friendly! He suggested the Shirahz wine, which was a perfect wine pairing to the prime rib. All in all, i wouldn't go out of my way or wait to dine here again.</review>

	<review>Good, not great, steak. Not cheap, but if you don't leave full then you really need to start thinking about portion control. Massive portions of meat with bread, salad, spinach, Yorkshire pud and a choice of mash or baked potato. Ate at the bar and the service was spot on.</review>

	<review>Hm i'm not sure what to rate this place, so i'll give it at 3. Had to keep calling for reservations as they were totally booked. The first time 2 weeks before, was at 1030pm but we called periodically and got our reservation moved up to 7:30 which was much better. We got there about 7:20 and sat in the waiting area. Our friend was already there. They had servers getting drinks and they gave snacks which was nice, especially since it was sembei, a japanese snack that i enjoyed! We had to wait for a while, maybe 1/2 an hour before our table was ready. The place started getting pretty crowded, and the lady that called our name was barely calling it as she went around the waiting area, luckily i heard her and asked again, apparently she was loosing her voice or something. So we finally got our table. Otherwise we were going to probably have to wait longer, or they might have even given away our table! The food was good, I loved the steak and the sides. I preferred the creamed corn over spinach, but the yorkshire pudding was good. I liked the salad as well, good portions and our server told us what was in it. I got the baked potato and it came with lots of sour cream and other goodies. Pretty good meal! I would only give 3 stars because our server didn't tell us that the triffle had alcohol in it and she could clearly see i was pregnant...so i ask her after i ate some and she said oh yes it does...wow. Also it was pretty hot in there and the water did not come with any ice, so we had to keep asking for some. Overall the food was good, service was ok and atmosphere could be better.</review>

	<review>I had high hopes for this place but maybe I'm just not a huge fan of prime rib. It's a bit stuffy with dated decor (not a bad thing) and friendly waiters. The dining room is loud (younger crowd), so quiet talkers beware. The drink menu is great for liquor and wine fans. The salad preparation (done at table) is interesting and the desserts are quite tasty. They also have their own branded knives which is pretty neat. To put it simply, it's a San Francisco landmark with solid service and reasonably priced meat. If you love prime rib, by all means go. If not, you might want to think twice.</review>

	<review>I wanted to love this place as much as it was raved about,  but I could only bring myself to just like it but feel it was nothing special. Our waiter Sean was super nice and that's it. He also didn't tell us his name we had to ask for it, but again it could have been one if those things. The house cut prime rib was good but that's it,  just good. The sides felt sort of not needed. I mean they weren't anything special. The salad basically tasted like crunchy thousand island (that's what their house dressing taste like), the bread was dense, the Yorkshire pudding was like a reject breakfast pasterie, cream of corn was bland, spinich cream or whatever was also bland. Although the baked potato was good. Again anything smothered in real butter, sourcream, chives and of course bacon is going to be good. other than that nothing special, i had better prime rib elsewhere. though this place is a nice place to take a date or even have a mini party meal, prices are reasonable.</review>

	<review>During our recent trip to San Francisco we made it a point to eat the HOPR because of all the stellar reviews from yelp and friends. Needless to say we had high expectations. Sadly our experience here was less than stellar and our group walked away disappointed. While it wasn't a horrible meal, I can't say it lived up to its hype and if anything proved itself to be more mediocre than anything. Let's start with service. Okay, this was the icing on the cake to our mediocre meal. After skimming through other reviews I got the gist that this place held itself to a higher standard of service. I'll give our server the benefit of the doubt that maybe it was just an "off" night for him but either way it was very poor. First off, when it came time to order drinks he seemed to be annoyed that were ordering cocktails. That really caught me off guard because most servers want you to order drinks. More drinks equals larger bill, and larger bill equals larger tip, but for whatever reason he wasn't too happy we were ordering drinks. Secondly, not only did he mix up our martinis, he knocked the shaker with the excess into my lap. So it wasn't the fruity lemon drop that I had ordered in my lap, it was the extra dirty martini my friend had ordered. Yuck. I know things get spilled all the time in restaurants but this time was pretty bad. It's a good thing I was wearing black leggings because if I had denim jeans on it would have look like I peed my pants! While the server did help to clean the area and apologize it pretty much ended at that. He brought a replacement drink and life went on. It would have been nice to at least have the $10 martini spilled onto my outfit taken off the bill or maybe even have a manager stop by and see how we were doing. I've eaten at enough nice places to know that incidents like this are not usually taken so lightly. The food itself was okay but I definitely wasn't blown away like many others. It could be that we have some awesome prime rib places where I come from, but either way I was underwhelmed. I had the King Louis VII cut which was the largest on the menu. Our server said this cut was about 16 ounces. Okay, that is a large piece of meat but to me 22 ounces, what I can get back home, is large. They do offer you a second thinner slice when you've finished your first but I'd rather be wowed with my initial plate and not finish it than ask for seconds. That I'm sure makes me sound like a heifer but it's just a personal preference. I'm sure it works out better for HOPR cost wise. The sides that came with the meal were okay too, nothing bad, nothing great. Maybe our poor service was an isolated incident, but either way it left a bad taste in my mouth. Instead of leaving happy and filled like I do from most restaurants, I left disappointed and smelling like a dirty martini. Would I try them again next time I'm in town? Maybe, but it'd have to be on someone else's bill!</review>

	<review>I gave this a 3-stars because I've got better service the 1st time I came here. I've had so much hope for this restaurant coming back the second time since it's the first time taking my bf here. Unfortunately, it wasn't as good as I expected.  -the waiting was very long....we waited for 1 hours and 30 mins  -the server was nice but she wasn't very polite when talking to us. We were just   looking at the salt bottle, and she said "don't you dare steal my salt."       Although that was just a joke, but that wasn't a clever one. The server didn't   seem to care about us much :( . - and we received a menu with the old prices on the steak, which totally confused me. I would definitely go back some time to give it another chance since I had a really good service my first time, and overall the food was great. :) Hope next time I'm back....it would be better</review>

	<review>I really wasn't sure how to take the House of Prime Rib. As a neo-ironic post-modern retro-dining experience it's up there with the best of them. But like many retro dining experiences, while providing a good dose of heart-warming (and belly-filling) nostalgia, it also makes you realise why restaurants moved on. I so wanted to love it, to allow myself to be hoisted aloft on a wave of sheer meaty, clubby tradition and to overlook the obvious problems. The over-iced, under-boozed manhattan wasn't a great start nor were the nuts in the suspiciously smeary miniature vases. The service was performance-grade, with characters out of central casting. The "chefs" wandering around in whites and two-foot toques gave it all the stamp of authenticity until you started to think "what do these guys actually have to do?" A menu that only gives you the choice of how thick you want your steak can't do much to inspire the creative juices of the kitchen staff. The food was Solid and Reliable. The salad was as hearty and filling as the steak. The meat was delicious - cooked to perfection with beautiful soft tasty fat and wonderfully tender lean combining very well. But the creamed spinach was a total disaster. Slop. The wonderfully crisp loaf of San Francisco 'sourdough' tasted rather more acetic than lactic making me suspect its sourness comes from a vinegar bottle. So, bottom line it's an event, a happening, a performance. It fills you up - it's now 6pm the next day and I'm still not hungry - and they do have some pretty good wines. But like all long-running shows, I get the suspicion that those providing it are just going through the motions and, dare I say it, getting a tad lazy. As a gastronomic experience it leaves rather a lot to be desired.</review>

	<review>Yes, it's probably one of the better prime ribs I've had but it wasn't mind blowing either. The au jus was delicious and I think that is what makes the dish. This place ONLY serves prime rib and fish. The day we went they had salmon and sea bass for the fish option. The gf doesn't eat beef so she went with the sea bass ($34.25). It was good but portion size was really small. If you opt for prime rib, you get a choice of 8oz to 16oz ($36.45-$41.85). They have different names for them, City cut, House cut, King Henry cut, etc. All the cuts come with a salad, potato (baked or mashed), creamed veggie (spinach or corn) and yorkshire pudding (taste like a popover). The yorkshire pudding is delicious dipped in au jus. What I love about this place is that they are very generous. If you can't decide what sides you want, they will offer all of them to you. If you finish your sides or prime rib, they will offer you seconds. The second slice of prime rib is paper thin but still where else do they offer seconds for free? Also, their martini's (including lemon drop, cosmo, apple martini, etc) comes in individual size shakers enough for two full glasses. They are all $9.50. Now where can you get two martinis for $9.50? They do have soda ($2.95) and yes there are free refills. Dessert was a let down. The Bread Pudding had a rubbery texture (don't know how else to describe it). The English Trifle was fine but it was literally a cup of fruit with a bit of creme sauce and a bit of cake. All desserts are $8. They will put a candle on your dessert and sing happy birthday if your table has a b-day. No complimentary b-day dessert here. Service was good not great. When my prime rib came, it was overdone. I told our server about it, he quickly took it away and got me another slice. He was pretty good checking on our drinks and water but we had to flag him down a few times for refills as well. You can come dressed up or in jeans and tee. You'll feel comfortable either way. I would give this place 4 stars but I'm holding back another star because I think they should offer seconds for non beef eaters too. Everyone at the table was still eating and getting seconds while my gf who ordered fish finished her plate and just had to sit there and watch us all eat. The fish she ordered was really small and it even came on a small plate compared to our beef plates. I know her plate is cheaper than the beef by a few dollars but I would gladly pay $3-$7 more (like the beef) and get a bigger piece and be offered seconds if she finishes her plate and not feel left out from the rest. Great place if you love prime rib, not so great if you don't.</review>

	<review>I'm suffering from a salt hangover as I type this review. I treated my boyfriend to a birthday dinner here last night . We were both HoPR virgins.  We had a reservation and checked in early, so we were actually seated 10 minutes before our reservation time. Sweet! Our server was Scott. He rocked. Great service all around, from front desk to meeting our carver to the guy who places the corn bread on your bread plate to when I placed my credit card inside the pleather portfolio.  Truly 5 star service.   Onto the food - if you have high blood pressure or are on a limited salt diet, stay away!!! Fortunately my blood pressure is normal and I don't have any dietary restrictions (yet), but goodness I'm still feeling it.  Everything was so salty. I loved the tableside tossed salad, but it was too salty.  The au jus was too salty.  The mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious and salty, and the gravy was even saltier.  The creamed spinach was to die for with its little bacon bits, but also a bit salty. It was my first time eating Yorkshire pudding, and ours was a bit burnt and (surprise!) too salty. The prime rib was not too salty, but it wasn't as tasty as I'd hoped.  I think next time I'd get it medium-rare (I ordered medium, which in retrospect was a mistake).  I drank almost an entire carafe of water during our meal. And yes, I realize that HoPR's prime rib is packed in salt during the aging process, but most of the non-prime rib items were salty with a capital S. I enjoyed the fresh horseradish (they place a trio of horseradish sauces on your table) and the sourdough bread was warm and tasty. For dessert, I had the trifle (perfect!) and my boyfriend enjoyed the apple crisp which was also delicious and decadent. When we got home he passed out on the couch and I stepped on the scale and discovered I gained 5 pounds since weighing myself that morning  =O Dining at the HoPR is a unique experience that I enjoyed, I just could've done with a little less salt.  Also, I was expecting the star of the meal, the prime rib, to knock my socks off and it was just ok.</review>

	<review>I wish they let us have the choice to do 3.5! .... Took my friend here for his birthday dinner, wanted to see what the hype was all about since EVERYONE loves this place so much. Got here, waited 15 mins for our table? Not too bad, they had a lounge area where we can chill and wait, we ordered cocktails to kill time. Their mojitos are quite big I must say. Got to our table, our waitress was friendly, but we had a hard time understanding her lol, we got our bread, salad, Yorkshire pudding, cream corn, cream spinach and baked potatoe! LOl a lot of food before our main entree. That gave it a few pointers but by the time I got my plate I was stuffed from all that bread! Disappointed that the prime rib both me and my friend ordered wasn't all that good it was semi dry.... and I always order rare so... how can it be dry? Wasn't tender... quite disappointing. But I guess we went there for the experience cause everyone went there, I personally think Broadway prime in San Mateo is better. But we took our little picture which came in a cute little frame. So despite that our rib wasn't all that great tasting, we had a fun time, service was decent. Price wasn't bad at all under 40 bucks for prime rib?! I think the alcohol ran up my tab more than the steak it self haha.</review>

	<review>This is a fancy schmanzy place minutes from Ghiradelli and Downtown. The place is somehwat overrated. I mean the prime rib is good but it's not like AMAZING. And for at least $50 pp if you order nothing else, it's not the best value. Also, I don't know if it is just recently, but I swear there is way less room to walk in the restaurant. I have to squeeze by people on the way to our seats, and also on the way to the restroom. The service was fairly nice but it's to be expected for this kind of restaurant. It's definitely A-OK but nothing spectacular.</review>

	<review>Going out for a big beef plate is an annual event with a particular group of my family and friends.  It's called "MeatFest" and this year's venue was House of Prime Rib in San Francisco.  Overall, we were not disappointed; the beef was very tender and cooked to perfection.  However, the menu is pretty limited to beef, beef, or beef, and there aren't a lot of side dish options either.  But, if all you're craving is Prime Rib, this place fits the bill. Our table began with the Salad Bowl, a mix of greens prepared at the table and tossed in a house dressing that resembles Russian dressing.  It was pretty tasty and the sourdough bread served along with it (warm, by the way) was fantastic. In true gender-stereotype fashion, the ladies ordered  the "City Cut", which is the smallest cut for a lighter appetite while the two men totally went for it by ordering the "King Henry the VIII cut", an extra-generous, thick cut of prime beef with the bone.  And, if you finish your King Henry, you will be offered an additional slice at no extra charge.  One of our guys went for it and lived to tell the tale.  The sides were creamed spinach and creamed corn, both very tasty.  The Yorkshire pudding was yummy but don't expect a popover style - this is more like a pancake and good for sopping up meat juices.  Desserts are hit-or-miss but that's really not the point of going to a place called House of Prime Rib. A word about the wine list; it is very solid with many quality offerings.  But the vintages are pretty young for drinking with big slabs of beef and the prices tend to be high. (I am currently drinking 10 - 15 yr. old cabernet sauvignons.)  One gets the sense that the restaurant is taking full advantage of their SF-based price mark ups.  If you have a nice bottle of something at home, bring it.  You'll be drinking better wine for cheaper as the corkage still is far less than a good bottle of too young wine that may or may not complement the meal. One final thing - don't come here for an intimate dining experience.  It is loud and crowded.  Some parties were very dressed up while others were completely casual.  It's almost like a diner in that regard - very busy with good but formulaic food.  We had a swell time, but MeatFest 2013 will definitely seek out a different dining establishment.</review>

	<review>I had heard alot about how good this restaurant and wanted to try it.  My wife, daughter and I were shopping in SF yesterday and decided to try it.  the only reservation was at 4:30PM and the place was packed already and the host said that there is no down time.  The atmosphere is very nice and the waiting area had a TV.  The menu is extremely limited, just different sizes if prime rib and a fish dish.  The sides were also very limited and no soup was available.  Each of us ordered the standard size cut, with mashed potatoes, and creamed spinach.  The meat was ok but not outstanding and not overly generous.  The standard salad was actually above average and large.  The mashed potatoes were lousy!  It was too watery and tasted like it was from a box.  The creamed spinach also was only so-so.  There should have been grilled veggies such as broccolli or squash.  I would not come back to this restaurant but I guess it does not need my recommendation.</review>

	<review>A good place to try once or twice,  but far from being mind-blowing. Came here on two separate occasions, and both times the experience did not live up to my expectations. PROS: 1) Yorkshire pudding is delicious 2) Creamed spinach was awesome too 3) Meat was soft and melted in my mouth 4) HUGE portions.  They even give you seconds.   CONS: 1) Meat: both times I went, I felt like the meat was lukewarm and I wished it could be hotter. 2) Service: Our waitress was terrible during my first trip.  She had a really thick accent and we had to ask her to repeat everything twice before we could barely understand her.  She mixed up our orders and we had to switch them around ourselves after.  She also forgot that I had told her it was my boyfriend's birthday (because they do a little special singing + cake + picture thing for birthday guests).  I had told her more than once at the beginning of the dinner, and kept eyeing her at the end too, but she still forgot.  My expression eventually gave it away and my boyfriend said it was okay because he didn't want all that attention anyway.  Yes it was a busy night, but still.  Hated the waitress. 3) During our second trip, there were three of us and they seated us at a side booth that was way too uncomfortably close to the big party next to us.  The table was slightly unstable too.  Eventually things spilled and splashed onto both tables.   Both my experiences at HOPR affirmed that while it's definitely a restaurant to try out in the city, it really isn't mind-blowing if that's what you're looking for.</review>

	<review>This place had it's ups and downs... Downs: STAY AWAY FROM THE BARTENDER.. I went on a Friday night and whoever was behind the bar was hating life (some caucasian lady with hair tied back into a pony tail like an angry catholic school teacher).. Really impatient and very rude. I had reservations, and had to wait about 40 minutes to be seated... this was understandable considering how busy they were. The host was really polite and apologetic about it and gave me and my friend free wine.. sooo problem neutralized... Ups: Besides the bartender, VERY nice staff. The decoration and atmosphere was really nice.  The food was overall decent. The King Henry Cut Prime rib was great, couldn't finish it. Everything else was about average : salad, baked patato, etc.. Overall, this place really isn't worth the hype. Good for a one time experience though. Maybe I don't eat prime rib enough to appreciate the difference.</review>

	<review>So my dad came in for a visit from Florida and being he used to be a butcher I thought why not take him to The House Of Prime Rib.( http://www.yelp.com/biz_… ) Our night starts with $8 curb side valet parking. Once inside the space opens up to one of the best steak house dining room I have been in. I mean most steak houses model there dining rooms after this one. Once seated we were greeted by our waiter. He was very nice, friendly and knew his stuff. After our drink orders were taken a nice loaf of sourdough came to the table followed by a house salad. The salad to me felt way over dressed and soggy.  Now on to the meat. The meat cable car as I like to call it came around and  I ordered The City Cut of prime rib which should be about an 8oz cut. Our waiter assured us that our meat  carver was the best in the business. However we felt his carving skills were a bit off being our meat was cut on a slant, not something you should see from the best in the business. The meat tasted good but it's a choice cut of beef at best. Each prime rib comes with potatoes ether baked or mashed and ether creamed corn or creamed spinach. I opted for the mashed and creamed corn. Both side dishes were awesome and made the overall meal good. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_… ) All in all this was a check the box, been there done that dining experience for me. Don't think I'll be back unless it on someone else's dime. 3.5 Stars</review>

	<review>OK, my review might be a tad bias just because I am not a huge fan of steak, but yeah... I've def had better steak (including at Ruth's Chris which is located only several blocks away). Maybe it was the whack service we had, or the fact that I was stuffed with warm yummy bread + sides [the Yorkshire pudding was the best, followed closely by the baked potato - the creamed spinach is not worth ordering]... But by the time the prime rib finally came out, I was just not feelin' it. Tip 1: YOU NEED TO MAKE A RESERVATION! I think we came on a weekday around 8-ish and the restaurant was packed. Tip 2: You can ask for seconds of whatever meat you ordered in the event you are still hungry.</review>

	<review>Make sure you make reservations, because yea it is that type of restaurant  and waiting area is non existent. but there is a bar. Immediately walking in it is crowded. HOstess dressed nicely in suits and waiters were also dressed nicely which made for a good first impression. We came with a big group of 15 ppl. waited about 15 minutes to be seated, and this was with reservations. Like other reviews stated, this place is so dim! but bright enough to see what you were eating. Prices are decent for the amount of prime rib given, ranges from 27-40something. And this already includes two sides, salad and of course free bread. -the salad: the waiter came out with this hella big bowl, and mixed the salad in front of us. He then plated the salad and they were passed down. also served with freshly cracked pepper. -Ordering: you order the type of cut you want and also the sides, which come in the same plate, unless you ordered the corn or baked potato which comes in a separate dish. but yea, just be aware bc if you do not like your sides touching the prime roast sauce then you might want to request for separate plating. what we ordered: -the king henry cut: this was a good size considering we were sharing (which costed an extra $7 to share). we still didn't even finish amongst us two. the sides we got were the fully loaded potato, which was made for us on the spot. it was decent. the creamed spinach was yuck! I dont know maybe because the spinach was hella creamed to the point where it looked like green puke. -seconds: you are allowed to get another PIECE/SLICe of the prime rib with a little portion of ONE side IF you finish your meat!!!! and BEware, you are NOT allowed to have it wrapped to take home!!! so if you want, you can have them wrap up something from your first plate, then when they are not looking put the extra slice inside that to take home box! lol, please do not get caught on my behalf! In general, the service was nice and attentive for a group of 15. the quality and taste of the meat matched the price....now compared to alexander's, house of prime rib is mediocre. but at least at house of prime rib your price includes two sides and a salad.</review>

	<review>Came here finally after all these years of hearing about this place, but definitely nothing really to rave about. They are really strict about having all of your party there before being seated even if you have reservations. The waiter was nice, but a little much. He kept coming by to ask if everything was okay. The food was good, but not great. Definitely not worth all the trouble of planning out dinner so far in advance and to get reservations. Then also to look for parking on van ness. But definitely was worth a try. good for a date? but seemed like everyone around us was on a date and very much dressed up. The pricing wasn't too bad not enough to get me in a dress for a date at least!</review>

	<review>Not sure I had the best experience here and maybe because I had high expectations  for this place. Where to start..... my hubby and a friend had a late reservation one night and only because we usually work late and drive all the way from Fremont.  We were late for our reservations but we called in and they were very understanding.  When we got there we waited in a nice cozy area with the fireplace going.  We ordered a few cocktails from the bar.  The ambiance is very charming and looked kind of fancy.  Lights were dim and kind of had a romantic ambiance but was really loud. Once you get seated, you can't help but to look around and notice everyone seemed like they were enjoying themselves.  We ordered a bottle of wine and was served cornbread.  This was really good...I wish I had another piece.  The menu is fairly simple to order from.  You choose the cut you want your prime rib cut and all of us got the King Henry VIII $39.85.  Each prime rib dinner is accompanied by salad, mashed potatos or baked potato, yorkshire pudding, creamed spinach, fresh cream of horseradish. The server comes by and pushes the cart of prime rib and slice a piece for you.  The prime rib we got looked like we got the end of it.  Overall, I was not impressed with my meat and maybe because the cut was just so fatty!  Seriously, I love prime rib but I probably should have ordered the English cut.  Sorry I want to enjoy a piece of meat but this meat was way out control with the amount of fat I had to cut out and  thank goodness I didn't eat the whole prime rib or my trainer would have killed me.  My hubby was not either pleased and ended up getting a stomach ache the next day.  He might of had a bad piece.  Last time this happened was when he had a Florentine Steak in Italy.  I did though enjoy the creamed spinach and my mash potato. I may have to come back and give this place another try and probably come earlier in the evening.  They take reservations, but you'll need to book it in advance.</review>

	<review>I was really excited to dine here with my bf's family to celebrate a birthday last night. I'm truly a carnivore, I LOVE meat.. so when I heard "prime rib"..HELL YEAH, I'm IN!! REVIEW SUMMARY: Prime Ribs: 4 STARS Cornbread: 5 STARS Sides: 1 STAR Dessert: 4 STARS Service: 3 STARS Ambience: 0 STAR!!!! TOO LOUD AND TEMPERATURE in the room was TOO HOT!! We had an 8:30 reservation on a thursday night. We parked (free) on Clay street. We arrived about 5 minutes earlier than our reservation time and waited about 15 minutes to get seated. The place was CHAOTIC!! EXTREMELY CROWDED, EXTREMELY LOUD!!! It was somewhat disappointing as I was expecting a warmer, cozier environment. Most of us ordered the "house cut," only one of us ordered the "king cut." The bread was served warm, yummm!!!, I do prefer they would have sliced them instead of having us to tackle the hard sourdough bread on a tiny cutting board. It was somewhat unappetizing when I saw our table was covered in bread crumbs (from cutting the bread). The table was a bit tight with all the glasses, plates and silverwares... the crumbs made it looked very sloppy. The cornbread was too die for...I must admit, the best cornbread I've ever had! The salad, while the way they put on the plate was kinda sloppy, actually tasted pretty good. The family also enjoyed watching the server mixed the salad table-side. The baked potatoes were GIGANTIC, seriously, it could feed 2 easily!!! We ordered them "loaded." The potatoes were a bit too dry and I disliked the super-tiny-bacon-crumbs..I prefer my bacon CHUNKIER! The cream of spinach was MEEEEHHHH!!!! The yorkshire pudding was good BUT some were burnt! The prime ribs were DELICIOUS and tender. I only wish that the meat was "warmer." They had a moving cart to serve the prime rib..I'm guessing that's causing the meat to somewhat cool down in the process. Also, I wish they would have given us extra au jus sauce on the table. It took a while to flag the server to ask for more sauce. The three kinds of horseradish sauces (mild, medium and strong) were a HIT though... the family usually hated horseradish. They gave the birthday girl a free chocolate ice (they asked what flavor she would like) with a candle and sang her a "happy birthday." They also took photo of the whole entire table AND gave her a copy with a card!!! We could go to their website and printed as many copies we want!! WOW!!! We also ordered the fantasy cake to share, it was delicious.. and we loved the slightly sour raspberry sauce that they served with the rich three layers "chocolate cake, chocolate mousse and cheesecake" fantasy dessert to tone down the richness and sweetness of the dessert. The room WAS EXTREMELY HOT!!! I was wearing a skirt BUT my thighs were sweating!! It was uncomfortable...they should have turned up the A/C to accommodate all the body heat (there were about 100+ people in the restaurant!). Total was around $350 including tax and tip (we only ordered 1 bottle of wine). It was not too bad for 6 adults, but the overall experience was a bit less to be desirable for us to drive 1 hour to the city to dine there again.</review>

	<review>We were hoping for something more as we had heard so much about this place, turned out to be average. The ambiance was good, but the food wasn't as impressive. Don't get me wrong the prime rib was really good, but the sides with the exception of the baked potato were just ehhh. The service again, average. Not sure I'd go there again, but it was a good experience. I was glad it wasn't terribly expensive, but I was expecting an overall great experience with ALL the food and service. As a sidenote, good cocktails and definitely fork over the $8 for valet, it's worth not troubling yourself over looking for it in that area.</review>

	<review>After hearing so much about this place, we finally decided to go there for the bf's early birthday celebration. Granted, we got there a bit early for our 7pm reservation, but why can't be be seated when there were 2 or 3 booths just sitting there empty? Finally, we were seated in an awkward area towards the back? near the restrooms. If we can see the people sitting at the table in front of us like we were watching a live show, then that table probably shouldn't be there. Talk about awkward; they were looking at us looking at them... The food was good, not the "amazing" that i keep seeing on yelp. I have to say though that the loaded baked potato was awesome...and the meat-- tender, juicy...the au jus was pretty salty though. The prime rib was even good as leftovers the next day! No cornbread though; we saw it at the end when we were about to leave =(.The service was good, even though the guy was super busy trying to cater to all the tables around us. It was our first time there and he was patiently explaining all the cuts and sides that came with the meal. Surprisingly, parking wasn't a hassle even though it was a Saturday night, so we didn't have to valet. Overall though, maybe I hyped it up too much in my head, so I was kinda underwhelmed.</review>

	<review>Delicious prime rib in an elegant and long-standing restaurant.  Their menu is extremely limited, so if you have special preferences for your non-prime-rib choices, you are out of luck.  The noise level in the area we sat in was extremely high, but I'm not sure whether the whole restaurant is this noisy.  Contrary to what one might think from reading their website, dessert is not included in the prix fixe dinner.</review>

	<review>Came here to celebrate my bf's birthday and the restaurant itself was beautiful and homey. I had reservations at 6 and was seated about 10 minutes after I got there. The salad was definitely overdressed and salty! I had a couple of bites and couldn't eat it anymore. I didn't care much for the salad because I was looking forward to my prime rib! Mashed Potatoes were awesome! Super creamy and rich! Creamed corned was good, pretty ordinary. Creamed spinach tasted exactly like beef jerky...NO KIDDING! Prime rib was delicious. It was juicy and tender and I love the Au ju! The fatty parts were the best and they give you generous portions. Next time I will order the city cut. The food was good, not great but it came at a hefty price! Its about 3.5 stars.</review>

	<review>i must say, I was a bit disappointed with this place. Maybe it is because I went in with such high hopes or maybe it was just a bad day, but I didn't think the food was as good as it could have been. I didn't feel that the meat had enough flavors, and I was not a fan of their cream corn, which tasted like they used canned goods. Mashed potatoes was amazing, however. Especially with such high price, I am not sure if I ever want to go back there again. But, if you are still willing to try it out, make sure to make reservations early! This place is loved by many and is very popular!</review>

	<review>PROS: -Good Service (You're basically paying for the service) -Simple Menu (Basically just prime rib) -Good Food (Juicy tender prime rib) CONS: -Pricey For Prime Rib (Again, you're paying for the service) -Your Fart Will Smell (It's the dry-aged beef) -Your Poop Will Smell (Again, it's the dry-aged beef) Good place to try out dry-aged beef, if only once in your lifetime. Be warned: Take some Gas-X if you plan to hook up with your date later that night or even the next day!!!  Actually, you might not want to be around her if she's feeling gassy.  Better yet, just tell her that you'll see her in a few days.</review>

	<review>What they did well: The aged juicy prime rib was above average and respectable. The fresh baked sourdough bread was hot and very good SF style. Creamed spinach with bacon Choice of mashed or baked potato Server was attentive 3 types of horseradish What they can do to improve: 45 minute wait even with a reservation Update the interior dining areas.  What era is this supposed to be? Reduce the flour in the flat yorkshire pudding so it puffs up more. Make space for the serving cart so the carver can do table-side service instead of being introduced and then walking away to cut the meat.   Salad greens were fresh but dressing was plain and needs reformulation and some sourdough croutons with a few baby tomatoes (like Lawry's used to do). The price is 15-20% above what I think it's worth.   Not a good value.</review>

	<review>Called on a Friday afternoon to make a reservation for that night. The lady I spoke with said there was no need to make a reservation and to just come when they opened. Hmm... I heard that you usually need to make a reservation two weeks in advance. I asked the lady if she was sure it wouldn't be a long wait; she said no. I figured I'd just go with it since she seemed to know what she was talking about and it was a rainy day, so maybe it wouldn't be so busy? Who was I kidding. My husband and I got there at 5pm and the place was already packed. We ask how long the wait was and they said it would be about 1 and a half to 2 hours. My hubby was none to pleased since we were starving. We decide to wait in the lounge area where I ordered a lemon drop and my hubby ordered a ginger ale. My lemon drop was okay, a tad watered down. The hostess also brought us some japanese snack mix that was never refilled. Still starving... We were finally seated about an hour and a half later in a teeny tiny corner behind a door. Thankfully it was never bumped into. Anyway, let's get down to business. Salad: I've heard people rave about it, claiming it to be their favorite salad of all the salads they have ever eaten. Really? It was just an average salad, with somewhat wilted lettuce, way too many beets, hard boiled egg pieces (which I actually appreciated) and Thousand Island-ish dressing which was a tad too sour. Entrees: I had the House or Prime Rib Cut and my hubby had the King Henry VIII Cut, spinach for me, mashed potatoes for him, and yorkshire pudding for us both. The meat was excellent. Cooked to our liking (medium well for me, medium rare for him), juicy, flavorful. My spinach was kind of bland and had some weird minty aftertaste. And I didn't see or taste any bacon in it, which was a disappointment as I love bacon in just about anything. Hubby thought his mashed potatoes were okay, nothing out of the ordinary. I enjoyed the yorkshire pudding, hubby did not. We heard that you get a free second slice of your prime rib if you finish your first piece. My hubby finished his, but did not get a second cut. Even though our waitress did come over a few times to check up on us, she never asked if he wanted a second slice. I guess you have to ask for it??? So that was pretty disappointing for him. I just gave him the rest of my meat since I couldn't finish it. Overall, our first experience here was okay. My husband said he wouldn't come back here. I think he was just cranky 'cause we had a long wait when we thought we'd have none and we were both pretty hungry upon our arrival. I think we should give it another shot though. Next time, I will insist on making a reservation no matter what anyone says.</review>

	<review>Best Prime Rib i have had, I have been here a few times now although i don't much like Prime rib all that much( thats why i only gave it three stars). If you like Prime rib/Cream spinach and really good salad then this place is definitely for you. Cool thing is sometimes you will see famous people eating here, first time i came here (years ago) I saw Bryant Young (DE for the Niners) eating with his family although they lost that day, (damn niners). Def a good place to eat. Only selection is Prime rib its either cut thick,thicker, thin or into smaller thin pieces so no real explanation is needed for the menu (unless you are a moron).</review>

	<review>Came here for a bday dinner, made reservations about a week in advance and still got a 8:30 seating.  So if you want to come at a certain time, plan way ahead, this place is always crowded. This place makes it easy, order the cut of meat you want, sides drinks and done. We all got the King Henry Cut, wasn't as big as I remembered when I came here a while back.   We got a salad with our meal, mashed or baked potato, creamed corn or creamed spinach. Tried all of them and they're a o k. Nothing special. The meat was cut at their cart station and brought right to us. ** Did you know you can get seconds for free? If you finish your meat, you can ask for another cut, but they'll give you the City Cut, thinner cut than the King, but hey, it's free and go for it if you can actually eat all of it! Overall, this place is good, I don't know if it's the best? I can say for myself that I wouldn't wait if I didn't have reservations.  The prices are good.  Drink prices weren't that bad at the bar either.</review>

	<review>If you really like meat, you'll like this but for people who aren't that into it (like myself) it's just a suuuper overpriced meal.  Classy, good service but boy is it expensive at about 40-60 a plate.  The side of creamed corn or spinach is just eh, too.  Reservations are a must.  A nice spot to go with that special meat lover, but not a regular kinda joint.</review>

	<review>Came back recently and my experience was mixed, mostly due to the service (hence the 3-stars instead of 4-stars). Our quoted wait time was spot on. On a Sunday night around 7PM, we only had to wait 30 minutes. They have a great system down where you can relax and grab a drink at the bar and when your table is ready, they'll come around to find you. You won't have to lift a finger. While at the bar area, I'd suggest grabbing a martini drink with the shaker. It's a great deal and is pretty much 2 martini glasses-full for around $9. The huge ball of sourdough bread always comes out fresh and hot. However, it took a while for our waiter to come around with our salads and even longer (almost 20 minutes) for our prime rib. The salad was delicious as always. If you can't finish your salad, I'd suggest telling the busboys not to take your plate away so you can enjoy it later, if you so wish. Our waiter was also kind enough to bring us some corn bread when I asked him about it. I never had it before and I thought it was pretty good! I suggest asking your server for some because the cornbread-guy doesn't stop by every table. Unfortnately, that did not make up for the fact that our waiter was never around when we needed him. I had the HOPR cut, medium rare. My friend had the King Henry cut, rare. I have to admit, ordering your prime rib rare is a MUST! I thought my medium rare was good but my friend's rare was so tender and delicious!! Not bloody at all! If you think it's too "raw" for you, just pour some hot au jus over it and it'll be fine. In addition, I also thought that the mashed potato was better than the baked potato this time around. The yorkshire pudding was an eggy, excellent way of sopping up all the au jus. The creamed corn, unfortunately, was overcooked and not creamy at all! I think we got the bottom portion of the pot :( I mentioned that we were celebrating my friend's birthday, so he received a small scoop of vanilla ice cream, a candle, and a nice, embarrassingly loud Happy Birthday song. :) I also liked how our waiter took a picture and printed it out for us as a keepsake. Overall, the best place in town for prime rib. For around $35-40, you get a huge plate of salad, prime rib, potatoes, a side, and bread! Service is not the best and can take a while but I guess that's hit or miss.</review>

	<review>Not much to say with 3000+ reviews for this place, but here were my main takeaways: - Without a reservation, get there early! We got seated right away around 5pm on Friday (party of 2). - Medium rare is more on the medium side. - Pass on the creamed corn - it was completely bland and tasted like baby food. We didn't really like the creamed spinach either. - Ask for extra jus to sop everything up / take home with leftovers.</review>

	<review>Came here for my birthday a few months ago. Food was pretty good, but left me wanting more, even after the second helpings. King Henry Cut was quite a bit smaller than I expected, and the second helpings was just a super thin slice of prime rib and didn't come with sides like my friends said. Pretty disappointed at this price point. Yes, I know  the main course comes with a ton of sides, but even then the sides were kinda minimal. I guess I'm spoiled by big portions at decent prices... This is just me though, as I'm sure all this is more than enough for many so don't hate on me too much. I just have a big appetite, for the most part! Good, but probably won't be back unless someone wants to go here to celebrate a special occasion like I did. I guess it was just something to cross off my bucket list.</review>

	<review>Great food for a very fair price! I came here this past weekend to celebrate my birthday with a few of my friends and there were a few things I didn't like but overall I was fairly impressed. Likes: 1. Very fairly priced 2. The bread and salad were delicious 3. You can get another helping if your first was not enough for FREE! 4. Prime rib was pretty good and they didn't overcook it when I asked for medium rare Dislikes: 1. Didn't really like that we made a reservation for 10 and they made us wait40 min since we had an extra person.. we could have just pulled up a chair.... 2. It wasn't a very polished restaurant (but still great for groups)</review>

	<review>pros: Been here 10 plus times, Prime rib is the best in SF, prepared horse radish makes me cry, salad is cold, sweet and crisp. cons: The creamed corn seems like it was made out of canned corn and is  not good.  The creamed spinach is ok.  Lawry's has better sides.</review>

	<review>To be clear, this was the best prime rib and even just the best steak period that I've ever had in my life. Utterly delicious. Totally worth 5 stars. But the experience itself was probably the most draining experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. We were PLEADING for our check by the end. We sat down at our table at 7:30 and promptly placed our order. We didn't get our salad until around 8:00. A half hour of nibbling on bread is a bit much, but not terrible I suppose. The salad was cool and refreshing which we were so grateful for because it was HOT inside the restaurant. And I'm talking, seriously sweating in our clothes and asking for a bowl of ice kind of hot. And after the salad, we waited. And waited. Our prime rib didn't show up until around 8:45, over an hour into our meal! Jesus Christ. By around 8:30 we were gazing around the room, glassy eyed and energy depleting. sitting in this sweltering room with no idea of when our food was coming out. And wondering if it was even going to be worth it? During this entire time, our server (who was very friendly) barely checked in on us. Drinks would be forgotten, crumbs were not swept up even once during the entire meal, no reassurances or explanations about the delay in the food was given until we flagged down our waiter to ask what was up. When the food came, it was glorious. Honestly, just wonderful. But after we had scarfed down our food, we waited for our server to check in on us. Clear the plates, get the check. But we had to just linger in that room for a good half hour more while we repeatedly asked for our check. At the very end, even after having asked for our check with desperation clear in our faces, our server came over bearing a dessert menu. Noooooo! Get us out of this room! It wasn't until around 9:30 that we finally escaped into the cool crisp air outside. All in all, the food was to die for. But would I go back any time soon? My god, I don't know if I can withstand it. I might have to work on my endurance a bit. A 2 hour meal with half hour lulls in between courses in a stuffy hot room? That's a test of will.</review>

	<review>Likes: I really like the english cut... the regular cut was not nearly as melt-in-mouth-ish. - tasty gravy - complimentary sparkling water - cream corn MMM - creme brûlée and english trifles for dessert - mashed potatoes and varieties of horseradish Dislikes: - lukewarm meat - long wait despite having made reservations - cream spinach YUCKKKK - why do i have to cut the bread myself?!?!</review>

	<review>The place is solid. First time i ate there was about 8-9 years ago, most recent was last night. Love the salad and the simplicity of the menu...thin, medium or huge cut of Prime Rib!  I mean who doesn't love this place? Even the entire offensive line for the 49er's were in the house last night.   I one complaint was the about the table they sat us at. We were a group of 8 (had reservations) and they stuck us at a table that was made up of one round table and a tiny square table the placed next to it. The 3 of us on the small table had zero room, of course when i asked the hostesses is she could do something about it, she gave me the "i'll see what i can do" but never reappeared.  Good thing the rest of the staff made up for lack of effort.</review>

	<review>If you've been to Lawry's in LA, then you are no stranger to this place. I don't really need to talk about the food since there are plenty of reviews doing that already. But what you may not know is that you can get seconds for free. Don't expect the same size, it'll be roughly half. But who cares, it's free!! The martini's are a great deal. The bartender will give you a container for the remaining drink that doesn't fit in your glass. You actually get about 3 drinks for the price of 1. Reservations are highly recommended.</review>

	<review>Came here in Aug. Service great, alcoholic drinks were strong, steaks were excellent. Sides weren't to die for, price was pricy. Will come back for special occasions to impress someone, otherwise I think a locate steak joint will work for me. The bill for 10 ppl came up to 700 dollars.</review>

	<review>Really good prime rib... King Henry Viii ftw. Tough act to follow but if you're looking for a place that one-ups them, Alexander's amazing prime rib can be had for $35 on Sunday nights and it comes with an appetizer.  Because of taste alone I'd pick Alexander's but I wouldn't mind coming back here for another King Henry.</review>

	<review>The best prime rib and the best service, but man, it is loud in there! The last time we went there, they tried to seat us in the middle of the room right next two three big, loud, and drunk groups of people. Luckily, we saw a booth in the corner opened up and we asked to be reseated. I felt sorry for the couple who were seated there instead of us. And he was proposing too.... I like the city cut because no bones are involved and you can always ask for seconds. The creamed spinach is also delicious! I never have room for dessert after.</review>

	<review>As much as I love this place they are not as consistent as I like them to be.  Also the service is not consistent.  It's a hit or miss but I do have to say last 2 times I went was before they were closing so maybe that's why it didn't feel as up to par as Ussual.  Eitherway no excuse for them we spend over $250 each time we come here I expect it to be on point..</review>

	<review>I come here for the fish. Oh, wait. You said, "House of PRIME RIB." Excuse me. What to order ... what to order ... what to order. How about a fist-thick slice of bloody beef cut from half a cow mere inches from your table? Yes, I'll have that. And you might as well bring the doggy bag with the salad.</review>

	<review>4 stars for food; 3 stars for service. Like everyone else has mentioned, the prime rib is delicious!  Tender, juicy and cooked to perfection.  The sides are all tasty as well.  My favorites were the yorkshire pudding and cream of corn. Our first server was horrible, so we got a new one.  The place looks dated, but shouldn't matter because the food was good.  Drinks are extremely strong, another bonus.  We came for a birthday so they took a picture for us, printed it out, and put it in card-- a very nice touch.  The prices aren't bad either. I don't know how often I can consume so much food, but when I'm hungry, I'll be back.</review>

	<review>Exclusively prime rib (obviously?) We came as a last second decision, encouraged by some coworkers, so wasn't able to make a reservation, though they encouraged us to walk in saying "it's not a problem." After showing up at 515p on a Saturday, we were told the walk-in wait would be 1.5-2.5hrs. We decided to wait, headed for the lounge where service was very attentive.  Not a very comfortable lounge though, with a smallish TV. We were seated an hour later in a moderately cramped space by the doorway.  Tables were very close together and the area we were seated in felt overly-cozy.  Pant legs were constantly brushing against our seats.  We could tell our waitress was trying hard to be attentive, but she was stretched thin between numerous birthday tables. Everything is included in the price of the steak (salad, steak, mashed vs baked potatoes, creamed spinich vs corn, yorkshire pudding).  The menu boils down to small, medium, or large portions, with the medium divided into "House cut" or "English cut" which is the same amount of meat with thinner slices. The salad is moderately better than average, but not worth filling up on.  Bread is fresh and good.  Sides are all average.  The prime rib is better than your average steakhouse prime rib, and the au jus is superb.  Ask for a second slice after you're done with the first. We passed on dessert. As I've stated in a different review, we regretted ordering wine that did not match the quality of the steak.  Even the $15 glasses are relatively low class.  Consider bringing your own ($20 corkage for the first couple bottles)</review>

	<review>Pros: + Excellent Prime rib will melt in your mouth (will range from $37-40 a person w/o drinks) + Comes with 2 sides, salad, yorkshire pudding, sourdough bread and corn bread + You will be STUFFED when you leave + They offer an additional cut if you are still hungry + Au Jus sauce is amazing + Value was good for the quality and amount of food you get: 2 people was $130 after tax/tip (2 entrees and 3 drinks) Cons: - Must make reservations ahead of time, gets very busy! You can wait in their lounge area if you are a walk in, but will be 1.5 hour wait. - Ambiance is kinda strange. They try to make it formal by diming the lights down low but it feels like a dark Bucca di Pepo. No dress code. - Cramped seating, too many tables packed into little space - You will be hearing the song happy birthday all night long - Service is mediocre. Our waitress was friendly but was too busy to provide us excellent service. Overall, the sides, service and ambiance were just ok but it's the tenderness and juiceness of the the Prime Rib will have me coming back for special occassions.</review>

	<review>Food was 3 stars but the service/ambiance was 5 stars so I guess that averages to 4 stars... Food: I ordered the House of Prime Rib Cut (14-15oz cut?). The prime ribs comes with 1) salad (with secret dressing)  2) mashed potatoes (or baked potatoes)   3) creamed spinach (or creamed corn)  4) Yorkshire pudding  5) sourdough bread  and some horseradish sauce (in 3 different spiciness levels). Here's the breakdown of what I thought of the food: - Prime ribs: I ordered it medium rare. It was decent, but not the best cut of meat I've had. The meat was juicy but lacked flavor. My cut was a bit on the fatty side too. I liked how they offered a SECOND 2-3oz complimentary slice if you can finish your first serving. - Salad: TOO MUCH DRESSING. It's good otherwise. I loved the beat and the nuts in it. - Mashed potatoes: creamy and buttery with well flavored gravy. Nice. -  creamed spinach: sprinkled with small pieces of bacon, the creamed spinach tasted and looked like there was a stick of butter in it, but I guess that's what made it taste so good. - Yorkshire pudding: So soft and fluffy, looks like a pancake but it was softer and not as sweet. Very interesting bread. Tasted good when dipped in gravy but otherwise, not that great to eat alone. -  Sourdough bread: So good! Hard crust on the outside and sooo soft and chewy on the inside! I would have eaten more but I was warned not to because I had to leave room for the other food! Ambiance: Really lively steak house joint. Semi-dressy but also accommodating to casual wear people (like myself). I really liked how chatty the whole restaurant was. It was just loud enough to be lively but not too loud where you can't even hear the other people sitting on your table talk. There is just a happy environment about this place.   Service: The waiter was AWESOME! So funny and so charming! Watching him make/serve the salad and the whole prime rib cutting was like a dinner AND a show! They were really good about refilling our water and waiting on our every need. The service was superb!! Price: The cut of meat I ordered was $38 and with tax and tip it came out to be around $50. I really don't think the food was worth $50 but I think the dining experience (ambiance and service) made the price a little more reasonable. Overall: It's great to try this place out since it was featured on No Reservation with Anthony Bourdain, but I don't think I'll come back.</review>

	<review>After hearing many rave reviews, seeing dining around the bay, and talking to friends and co-workers, my boyfriend and I decided to try the house of prime rib. We enjoy dining out and through recommendations have tried some of the best places in the bay! We made our reservation, 2 weeks in advance. Definitely call for a reservation, or you will be like all of the people we saw standing around looking miserable. Our reservation was at 9pm. We had a good drive ahead of us so we left early. We ended up getting to House of Prime Rib at 7:45pm. We pulled up to the valet and went into the restaurant. First glance it looks like an old English portion of a museum. Dark velvet curtains, dim lighting, everything  was very dark! It looked pretty though. They were trying to set a mood. People were lined up all through the restaurant waiting for tables. My boyfriend grabbed a table at the bar and I figured I'd check in early to see if we could be seated. I told the gentleman at the front we were very early but decided to check in, just in case. He said he would have us seated as soon as possible. I thanked him and walked over to the bar table. I figured we would order our bottle of wine and start drinking. After some deciding we placed our order, probably took 10 minutes max. I excused myself to use the restroom. The bathroom. Ok let me tell you I am a self proclaimed bathroom rater. I always have to check out the bathrooms. I am very critical. This bathroom, for the swankiness of this restaurant was horrendous. Two stalls for the women. Yes, there was a line, six women in line to use the bathroom! The toilet in one stall did not flush properly. The sink had poor pressure on the water. Definitely nothing to write home about, again especially for such a nice place! I headed out of the bathroom back to the bar table we had, and to my surprise on the way back noticed my boyfriend sitting at a table! 15 minutes we got seated, granted we did have a reservation but that was more than an hour away. So definitely a plus for this! Immediately the waitress brought our bottle of wine over, we had not even gotten a chance to drink it at the bar. Soon after the water came out. The table set up was nice, but sort of crowded with the two menus, the drink menu, the layers of silver, the plates and the two glasses each, one for water and one for wine. Our waitress came out propably ten minutes later. She was super bubbly and happy! She took our orders and brought us bread. While we waited and dined on the bread provided, randomly one of the serves brought a long oval treat. We couldn't figure out what it was, but it turned out being corn bread. It was really random like I said, didn't ask if we wanted it just dropped it on our plate. Ok then! The waitress came out and made our salad. Honestly it wasn't all that. I had a few bites and decided to wait until my meal, expecting it to be large and filling, after all we went with the King Henry 8! The food did come over very fast. The baked potato was amazing! They load that bad boy up with sour cream, chives, bacon, and butter. A huge helping and very good! We were introduced to our butcher as I called him.  Inside these giant metal containers were the prime rib blocks. Ours were cut off and placed on our plates. Aus jus was poured over it generously. We were then given Yorkshire pudding on top. I had never tried this before and it wasn't that great. I would compare it to a funnel cake with no sweetness. The meat was good, very tender and easy to eat. I ate mine quickly, but after I ate the potato as well realized I didn't have room for the second piece everyone hypes up on here. They offered us dessert, I passed, as I was full. The meal was all in all a fun experience, would I go back? Probably not. Once is fine, but multiple would not be my thing for this place.</review>

	<review>3.5 stars rounded up. A complete rip-off of Lawry's that executes at 95% of Lawry's quality. Literally everything is the same from the salad to the prime rib to the Yorkshire pudding. I guess I don't actually know who came first, but whatever Either way, the prime rib is solid, so are the sides, and the portions are large (they'll even give you a second free serving if you ask). Great service to boot. It was a little cramped, so while I was eating, I accidentally and unknowingly put my jacket elbow into a dish of sour cream. The restaurant manager noticed this, and gave me his card while offering to pay for my dry cleaning bill. In addition to footing my cleaning costs, this guy also had a bad-ass Euro name - something along the lines Gunther Gustafson. The type of name that would have you believe this restaurant manager moonlighted as a primary villain in a James Bond movie on the side.</review>

	<review>This place is all about having a fun experience. The food isn't amazing, but the ambiance, service and presentation make it a great time. I'm glad I went - but it was probably a one time thing. If you like meat, go to a Brazilian Churrasqueria.</review>

	<review>I ate here with my girlfriend for her birthday. This place is as good as it gets when you want some prime rib. The service was excellent - not overly attentive to guests (like some restaurants) which gets annoying sometimes yet attentive enough to be there when you need it. I normally do not eat salad but they're salad was exceptionally good. The steak was a bit un-done as medium rare but next time I will remember to get it a bit more cooked. And afterwards they took a picture for us as a souvenir. Four stars.</review>

	<review>I really love their Prime Rib. I don't think you can find a better one in the City. Their baked potato is awesome too and you can't go wrong with the menu. You really don't have to think hard about it. The only reason why I didn't give this place 5 stars is because of the salad. It's kinda soggy and disgusting. The spinach and creamed corn wasn't all that too. However, I still love this place and will continue to love this place since Prime Rib is hard to come by.</review>

	<review>House of Prime Rib.  Mmm prime rib.  Mmmm... Uh, excuse me while I wipe the saliva off my chin. Oh right, House of Prime Rib.  My salivary glands have already attested to the quality of the prime rib.  While I'm sure they also have plenty more to say about the creamed spinach, Yorkshire pudding, and mashed potatoes, I'll avoid a potentially embarrassing situation and simply say they are unbelievably delicious.  The creamed spinach tastes nothing like your childhood "finish your spinach or you're not leaving this table."  Trust me, you'll be pouncing on any waiter who tries to take that plate away from you.  The Yorkshire pudding, delivered straight to your plate from the pan, is so fluffy and soft it almost melts in your mouth.  And the best part: the horseradish sauce.  Freshly grated horseradish in that sour cream...I ask for it hot and I ask for a lot of it, and I make sure that is on my prime rib because anything else is a shame to the name. I'm only giving 4 stars because the last time I was there we were forced to wait an hour and twenty minutes WITH reservations.  The kind manager gave us complimentary desserts for our wait, but we were the last table in the restaurant by the time we reached our desserts.  Kind of neat to be the only table in such an establishment, but not neat waiting around for an hour and twenty watching hundreds of other people be served prime rib while being denied your own.  That's cruel and unusual punishment.</review>

	<review>If you like prime rib this is definitely the place to go, hence the name.  We went here for my husband's birthday the other night, and it was good.  You basically choose what size you want, and two sides to go with it, simple!  They have some fish too, but like the waiter said to the lady next to us, "uh, miss this is the house of prime rib, and I highly recommend the prime rib."  It stays pretty busy, so we usually call ahead to make reservations.  The down side, it the tables are really close together, and sometimes it hard to carry on conversations there.  The service is great to okay depending on who you get, but the food really is good!</review>

	<review>The steak with the horseradish is really good. The creamed spinach was okay.   What ruined it for me was the seating. We were seated in the back. Coincidentally, everyone else in there was Asian. I know, weird observation.  But the waiters kept hitting my chair.  I felt like I was sitting in the aisle seat of an airplane. The great thing was that they asked if I wanted seconds. You mean for free????  You gotta be kidding me! Too bad I was so stuffed!</review>

	<review>we had to wait about 45 minutes for our table, even though we had a reservation, which kinda sucked, but with the recent end to my career as a host, i understand.  one of the first things our waiter said was that he was hammered, which we thought was pretty cool, but it turns out he's kind of an angry drunk, because he was sort of a dick the whole night.   I know now that I do not like yorkshire pudding... i didn't expect it to taste like scrambled eggs, i expected it to taste like... pudding.   the salad was delicious, kind of a mix of gourmet and pizza hut, it was nice.  the mashed potatoes and cream spinach were delicious, and the meat... oh the meat.  a bigger cut of meat than I've ever had on my plate before, and i just had the standard house cut... it was huge!  and the spicy horseradish made my brain tingle, I suspect in the same way heroin would... it was heavenly. one star knocked for the wait at the beginning, but i'll definitely be back someday... when i'm rich.</review>

	<review>As a lover of prime rib and a frequent visitor to HOPR.. I found out that HOPR has added a few sides to try to par up to Lawrys  (ahem.. so the waitress insinuated). Recently on my visit there, I got offered cream corn. Now the cream corn at Lawrys is to DIE FOR!! HOPR made a good effort but feel short I feel that their creamed corn is a bit bland and too watery (where is the buttery goodness?). In addition, I got served a corn bread roll in the shape of a corn. Is this new? Again the corn bread lacked flavor. But Prime rib was darn good (a little fatty though)! Our waitress was seriously on crack - she talked a mile a minute and served food so fast I felt It gave me whiplash! Also waited about 15 minutes even with our reservation. Boo, but drank a cosmo while waiting.. (yummy)..</review>

	<review>I saved my appetite early on knowing that I will get to feast at the House of Prime Rib. I was not disappointed by the food: yummy sourdough bread, nice salad, and of course the main course, prime rib with side of cream spinach, mash potatoes, and Yorkshire pudding. I ate it all up, plate clean!  Also, I tried a few of their desserts: Tiramisu, Strawberry Shortcake, and Creme Brulee (my fave of the three). A tip to anyone who waits for their tables, even if you have reservations. Everyone in your party must be present before you get seated. If someone from your group leaves to use the restroom, momentarily, hostess will give away your table and make you all wait for the next available-so that's why I must minus one star.</review>

	<review>Found myself here on a date on a Saturday night. They managed to seat us in a little over an hour (no reservation, spur of the moment decision to come) and we proceeded with the feast. The food was great, very reminiscent of Lawry's Prime Rib in Chicago. Atmosphere ended up being a little loud for conversation in "indoor voices", which can be good or bad depending on how much you like your dining companion. In my case the noise level was a downer. This is not the place for the small of stomach, those who don't enjoy beef, or for those currently strapped for cash. You have been warned.</review>

	<review>After my Nonie died, my grandfather (Da) reconnected with an old lady friend who happened to be widowed herself. For 10 years, they were "together." I don't really know the parameters of their relationship, but Joanne O. became a big part of our family and like a second grandmother to me. Joanne's grandson, Man on the Inside, felt the same way about Da, possessing an intense appreciation for my incredibly wonderful and quirky grandfather. Both Joanne O. and Da have since passed away, and MOI and I have maintained a tradition of celebrating them with family dinners every few months. These dinners can only take place at restaurants Da and Joanne frequented and MOI always orders Da's drink, a Seven and Seven. After Da passed away, I was going through his things and found a fabulous Polaroid of him and Joanne, neatly fit in a House of Prime Rib paper frame. I treasured this Polaroid and kept it taped to my fridge. When MOI was shipped off to war in the Middle East, I gave him the Polaroid for good luck. The Polaroid has, needless to say, disappeared, and while MOI claims to have it "somewhere," I've been desperate for a present day replacement. Normally, our Da and Joanne dinners take place at Liverpool Lil's, however MOI refuses to dine there after an unfortunate run-in with some bad Beef Wellington. This was my chance for a Polaroid. "Hey, what about the House of Prime Rib?" "Reservations for 6. I'm on it." I was slightly worried the free Polaroid in the paper frame was a thing of the past, and I mentioned my concern to the family as we sat in the bar waiting to be seated. "Well just ask." "I don't want to ask." I whined. "That's dorky." What if the Polaroid costs a fortune? What if they don't make the frames anymore? What if I die without my House of Prime Rib Polaroid? An adorable man in a suit came over to seat us, asking for MOI and his party. Suddenly, he exclaimed, "BETH?!?" "Um, oh my god. Evan from kindergarten is the maitre'd at The House of Prime Rib." Screams, hugs, handshakes. I silently thought to myself, "Yes! Polaroid, here I come." Evan put us at a fabulous table and introduced us to our server, Becky, who was hilarious. MOI leaned over, in all seriousness. "You think I'm a Man on the Inside? That Evan guy's running the front of the House of Prime Rib. Talk about Man on the Inside." "Really?" "Uh, yeah Beth. That guy's connected." I think MOI has an unhealthy reverence for old time San Francisco, red-meat mafia joints, but I'm delighted to have such an in. I spotted Becky out of the corner of my eye, Polaroid camera in hand. "The Polaroid!" I screamed. I called Becky over and explained the long history of Da and Joanne O. "Oh my god, that's the cutest story I've ever heard. I love it. We're doing a photo shoot." "Folks." I announced. "Fix your hair. My dream is becoming a reality..."</review>

	<review>I came here last night for the first time with my boyfriend as my birthday dinner. The food here was alright but pales in comparison to the steak I had at Ruth's Chris for Valentine's Day. I got the city cut because I really do have a small appetite. Our server also gave us a really nice salad to enjoy before the steak. I was getting full from my salad and had more than half the plate to finish. I ended up not finishing the salad and my real meal was on its way. My boyfriend got the House of Prime Rib cut because he absolutely loves beef. He got cream of spinach and I got the cream of corn and we both got the mashed potatoes. As I cut my steak, it felt just luke warm like it was sitting there for a while and lacked in flavors. I'm just not for the natural flavors of House of Prime Rib, Ruth's Chris is more what I like. However, I had an enjoyable time here overall. They sang me "happy birthday" and even helped us take a picture that was later framed in a paper "House of Prime Rib" frame and given to me to take home. I'll definitely be back to persuade myself this place isn't as bad as I'm making it out to be. Thumbs for the show (mixing the salad) and taking a picture for us to take home.</review>

	<review>I have not been to the House of Prime Rib in nearly 10 years.  Like 10 years ago the food was fantastic!  My GF and I both had the King Henry cut.  I had the mash potatoes and the the baked potato.   The mash potatoes was very good.  However the baked potato was lacking.  I have had a better potato at Tahoe Joe's.  The Prime Rib was delicious.  So was the dessert we had at the end. I would of given House of Prime Rib 5 Stars if it was not for the bathrooms.  My GF had to as the hostess to restalk the women's bathroom.  As for the men's.  It was dirty and disgusting.  so 4 Star instead of 5-Star.</review>

	<review>My favorite prime rib place and been going here for over 12 years now.  Although they are only getting 4 stars due to two things.  One is the fact that I had never been seated at the reserved time.  Don't we make reservations so that we can get a table at the reserved time?  Come on now...! The other thing that knocks them down that fifth star is a particular time I was dining there about 2 years ago.  I always order rare prime rib and get seconds.  This one time I asked for seconds and the waiter came back and said they were out of rare...so I asked for medium rare...the waiter again returns and says he is out of that too...I asked what they had...he said well-done.  I was pretty upset and as I was eating with some elderly folks that I truly respect, I asked the waiter to crouch down so I can ask him something discreetly.  I asked..."what is this place called?"  He replied "The House of Prime Rib".  I answered back "well...I guess he ain't home today is he?!"  I dismissed my appetite for seconds and told him to go on his way.  Just gets me angry when an establishment runs out of their "known for" items.  It's like going to a Chinese restaurant and they say we are out of rice. Still love this place though and I go back all the time.</review>

	<review>For YEARS, my sister thought it was blasphemous that I have never been to House of Prime Rib - a San Francisco institution! So for her birthday, we came here to eat at one of her favorite places. Since I work in the city, they picked me up from work and we made early reservations for 5:30pm. Apparently, this was a great idea because we got seated immediately (from what my sister told me, if you ask for a later reservation, you will not be seated at your reservation time). We got seated in a quiet corner (a huge plus) in a booth, but my seat was AWFUL! There were rogue springs everywhere and it was lumpy. So the three of us had to squish and use only half of the table. I understand the decor and love the charm, but that was intimate. The salad was delicious, the prime rib was tender and juicy (i did miss that they didn't have a crust on the outside), and the sides were good. Overall, it was a good meal and I was so surprised at how affordable it was. I would give this place 3.5 stars, but my sister was so happy eating here that they deserve 4 stars just for making my sister so happy.</review>

	<review>This is my most frequented restaurant in the city, and it never disappoints food-wise. I always got the smallest cut medium rare, cream spinach and mash potatoes. The sour dough is also warm and fresh, and don't forget to ask for corn bread! The service can be shoddy -- watch out for the young girl with strawberry blond/red hair. She sucks. She has this sour, I'm an asshole aura that permeates the tables she serves.</review>

	<review>Been here for a birthday treat (and I ended up paying for it). What can I say, it's again a regular prime rib joint, nothing fancy. - Spinnng salade bowl is particulary good, filled up stomach with this rather than with the meat. - The first serving will surely make you full.</review>

	<review>So, I guess I'm the only one who didn't know this, but before coming here last night I was under the impression that HOPR was a steakhouse, and would have more than 6 options of what to eat.  Well, I now know that that is not the case, and if you're looking for even a tiny bit of variety, do not come here.  Only prime rib, and about 4 options for sides.  No appetizers.  No different varieties of steak. I guess you have to love this place for what it is, and only what it is.  I'm glad I came here for the first time to try it, but I don't know if i'll ever be back.  I'd opt for a full on steakhouse next time- I felt like it was 1952 in there last night.  Very, very basic and straightforward.  The prime rib was good, but believe it or not I think Izzy's has better prime rib and better au juis.  Also, their creamed corn was bad last night!  Really unflavorful and unimpressive.  The creamed spinach was good, but again, Izzy's has much better creamed spinach.  Skip the Yorkshire Pudding- it'll just fill you up and make you even more stuffed.  Not worth it. After reading all of the reviews about how the wait is always horrible even with reservations, I came in prepared to get a few drinks at the bar before sitting at our table.  To my surprise, our table was ready in under five minutes so that was a nice treat.  Oh, I'd also like to mention that the bartenders seem a bit amateur- when I ordered a mojito she made it with 7up instead of soda water.  Yea, sent it back...I have to question a bartender who isn't aware of how to make such a basic drink.  The drink prices were cheap as ever, though. A good meal, but I still prefer more variety in my meals eaten out.</review>

	<review>3 stars, I say.  Oh, but Ben, everyone lurves House O Prime Rib, you say.  So, let's talk about how we get to 3 stars. 1. Wifey and I arrive my customary 10 minutes early.  I give my name, rank, and serial number to the hostess, who checks the computer screen and says "Wait in the bar and we'll come get you when your table is ready."  This may seem a bit nit-picky, but I typically don't take orders from hostesses.  Try this instead: "I'm sorry, Mr. P., but your table isn't ready quite yet.  If you'd like to wait at the bar, we'll come and get you as soon as the table is ready."  Notice the subtle shift in politeness?  Almost like you're running a service business?  Restaurants need to stop hiring hostesses based on looks, and recognize that this person is the first interaction the customer will have upon walking in, thus the hostess needs to be the best customer service provider in the joint. 2. I wisely brought a jacket.  So did wifey.  The inside of the restaurant is clearly warm enough not to require wearing a jacket indoors.  And yet, no one offered to take my jacket.  Huge deal?  No.  But just one of many small departures from what I'd expect which, in the aggregate, lead to a 3-star review. 3. After being commanded to wait in the bar, wifey and I found a seat at a table in the bar, with a little menu on it, and waited to be waited on.  And waited.  And waited.  All the while, waitresses were flitting from table to table.  And we were waiting.  We were waited upon just about 30 seconds before I was going to get up and go to the bar and order. 4. We were finally seated in what must be the smallest 2-person booth allowable under ADA or FHA standards.  Right in front of the door, too.  This is the sort of table HOPR might seriously consider just eliminating. 5. I don't usually put 8 ounces of dressing on my salad, but when you prepare the salad in front of me, and do it at Roadrunner speed, it's hard for me to get a word in edgewise to tell you I'd prefer a dosage somewhere below the fatal 50. 6. Why did you take away the wine menu and make me ask you to bring it back?  We had just sat down when you whisked the menu away.  Now, I'll admit, there was barely room for it on the table.  But you're essentially accusing me of being cheap, and I haven't even ordered yet.  The bottle of Trefethan cab I eventually ordered was excellent, however.  And you get points for decanting it. 7. The apple pie crust looked and tasted like a thin cinnamon pancake.  WTF? Working in HOPR's favor was the following: 1. They did an excellent job of serving me the medium-well cut I asked for.  I was very worried about this, but they did it perfectly.  And the meat was excellent. 2. The super-secret horseradish sauce was amazing.  You have to press the waiter to get him to bring it out, and it will flat knock you on your ass.  Skip the two horseradish sauces they bring out voluntarily, and have your waiter go back in the kitchen and get the real stuff.  Use no more than a pea-sized amount per bite, or prepare for fireworks. It is also important to note that the many people who claim HOPR is the best steakhouse in the city are flat wrong, because you can't get steak here.  Just prime rib.  Exclusively.  Now, it's very very good prime rib, but that's a roast, not a steak. All in all, at just over $100/person, I've had better meals.</review>

	<review>Let's see, went on vacation to SF two weekends ago and made reservations at 9:00pm on Friday and I made my friends bust our ass to get their on time.  Had them running after we got off on the bus stop on Van Ness.  We were taking the bus at night and it wasn't so reliable, so I was sweating it.  What do you know once I got there we had to wait another 20-30 minutes to be seated.  That wouldn't have been so bad, but our orders took forever to come and it also took a long time for our server to take our orders.  We got our cuts of prime rib around 10:20-10:30.  I would have rated it worse if it weren't for our friendly waitress.  After finishing my meal she asked me if I wanted another 6 oz I think because our wait was so long and my prankster friends had told her that it was my birthday.  Thanks fellas for being 2 months late.  It was a Friday night and the restaurant seemed to be short on staff or something. The food was good, although not on par with Lawry's.  Still the House of Prime Rib is cheaper and it's a good bargain especially if you go with the a la carte as the only thing missing is the salad.  Personally I went with the House of Prime Rib cut and didn't choose the a la carte unlike my other friends.  The salad was much larger than I expected which contributed to my bloated evening.  For the sides I ordered the baked potato with the creamed corn.  Being Korean I love spicy food so I naturally requested the hottest horseradish sauce.  Made two of my friends try some which cracked me up seeing how they had repulsed looks on their faces just from it's smell.  At the end it cost $50 including tip which is better than Lawry's.  I would go there again cause if it didn't take an hour for us to get our food from the time we were seated it wouldn't have been a great time.  Still I give it a 3.5 stars.</review>

	<review>3.5 Stars. A really decent price for a great cut of prime rib. I am just not that big of a fan of prime rib. The price for one person is about $40.00, including a bread, LARGE salad, mashed or baked potatoes, yorkshire pudding (delicious), and creamed spinach (not a fan). I ordered the House of Prime Rib cut while the bf got the English cut. They were juicy and tasty if you like prime rib, the only problem was that the cuts weren't hot enough. Good to try once but I think I would only come back for if someone really wanted to come here.</review>

	<review>The prime rib excellent, but the side dishes weren't good. I know it's the house of prime rib, but I think the side dishes are just as important.  The creamed spinach and creamed corn were ok, the salad was like pizza hut salad bar salad they just made the salad look fancy by tossing it table side and served with an ice cold fork.  The yorkshire pudding was really good though.  Also the warm loaf of bread they bring out to start was fresh with good crust and soft dough.</review>

	<review>Great place for a bachelor "party" night  dinner. Men. Cooked meat. Potatoes. Mixed drinks and well-aged wine. In my group, military men who've been to Iraq and citizen X (me) are surrounded by locals who've seemed to also ID this spot - like the groom's brother did- as a spot for special occasions. On a busy Saturday night it took forever to be seated even with a reservation. That meant spending time at the bar and trying not to get too hammered to enjoy some prime rib. Beep, beep. Cougar alert. Cougar alert. As we stood by the bar, this group of older ladies would pass by and smile. They were in a group with a younger (twenty-something) chick so I paid little mind. Mother and daughter carnivores. Cute. A few more rounds go down. Finally table time. We get a great waiter. Very attentive. A little less vodka and I could tell you his name. However, as all the Spike TV humor is being tossed around like midgets into stacks of hay, camera flashes are lighting up from a nearby table. Crazy  cougar alert! A bottle-blond, craftily made up white cat is purr-ing a way to make us a part of her Asian-American daughters birthday. She asks who and what we are, takes some pics and tells one guy just how handsome he is. She made this military man blush red. Wow! (At the same time, the cougar's son cringed.) She had more to say, most of which I don't remember...thanks to some fine Zinfandel. The House of Prime Rib has an impressive display of vintage French bottles and an Opus One signed by the late Robert Mondavi. But if you venture in their special room on a self-guided tour the bartender will politely but directly tell you to get out. As for the food, I made the mistake of ordering medium well because I'm an out-of-town-er who never heard of this place and don't trust bloody meat to just anybody. My big piece of cow came well past medium well but the pre- and post-rib bite, including the Yorkshire pudding, were delicious. Most importantly, the groom had a great time at this San Fran institution, and that was the reason  we were there.</review>

	<review>The first time I went to hopr, which was about two years ago, I was thoroughly disappointed.  Mostly by the service.  It took our waiter about 15 minutes to even acknowledge us.  It took another 30 minutes to bring us our salad (mind you, just the salad).  We spent about 2.5hrs the first time dining there - most of it just waiting.  I was not a happy camper so I didn't go back for a while. I'm happy to say that I went back last night hoping for a better experience and got it.  Everything was so much better!  We had pretty late reservations...9pm.  They actually didn't seat us for about 10 minutes after 9.  We arrived 10 minutes before 9 so we hung out at the bar for about 20 minutes.   Our waiter - Dennis - was so friendly!  For the prime rib, I highly recommend getting your meat medium - and nothing more than that.  I ordered mine with the spinach and baked potato.  My potato was packed with everything - sour cream, bacon bits (a little much in fact), butter, and chives.  I'd never seen a fuller spud.  They had this 'table seasoning' on each table and I generally like my foods pretty salty so when my prime rib came, I was tossing a bunch of the seasoning on my meat.  After I was about 80% done, I took a closer look at the seasoning and realized it comprised of MSG.  No wonder I suffered a headache during dinner!  Steer clear of the seasoning if you don't bode well with MSG.   Our waiter was nice enough to give me a second slice of meat even though I didn't order the King Henry Cut.  My thoughts:  I don't think it's the best prime rib I've ever eaten but it's good.  For about $45.00 per person including tax and gratuity - I think it's worth trying.</review>

	<review>i had really high expectations for this place, especially for the food. the meat and mashed potatoes were great, but the salad, spinach and corn sides were just alright.  if you're not a huge salad fan, just get a la carte (it's cheaper!). despite the delicious pieces of meat,  there were SO MANY negatives that i need to rant about. here goes- -they only know well done, med and rare. don't go for the in betweens like med-well or med-rare. i highly recommend just getting medium. anything cooked more than that will be tough. -service was poor. it seemed like the waiter felt that our group of 12 were obligated to pay him the 18% gratuity already so he did not need to earn it. if you get a man that's a bit tubby and has facial hair, ask for a different waiter just in case. -two of my friends shared a plate- they did not get the complimentary slice AND had to pay $7.50 more. the waiter did not inform us until the bill came. -complimentary piece can't be taken home! =( bringing a ziploc baggy in my purse next time!</review>

	<review>Yum! good prime rib. I love how you get it all for one price, bread, salad, two sides, and yorkshire pudding. The salad is sooo good. I love that dressing. I can finish the whole thing but I must save room for the rest of the meal. Not a big fan of the creamed spinach but do love the creamed corn. Their mashed and baked potatoes are good. I usually end up really full by the end so I never had a chance to try their desserts yet. I do finish my prime rib but have never finished everything else. I always wished I was able to eat it all up. Service is attentive. But the rooms aren't that roomy. Tables are close to each other. The decor plus their food does give a homey feel. nice and cozy. Nothing too superb mainly I think its really worth it to get it all for one price for decent food. Can't wait to go back.</review>

	<review>As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a popular place for birthdays.  And for good reason.  HOPR is not a fine dining establishment but it has a lot of entertainment value, which is mostly what you're paying for when you come here. Even though we had reservations on a Tuesday night, apparently there is no such thing as a slow night here.  As predicted, we had to wait 30 minutes for our table to be ready.  However, management was right on top of things, coming to get us drinks right away, and then apologizing for the wait after 20 minutes and comping us the drinks (as well as asking those of us who didn't originally order drinks if we wanted any on the house). Food: - cornbread was nonexistent, not sure what happened - bread came out right away, okay - salad was as described in many other reviews, a little wet but still very tasty - prime rib was okay, very tender but not as tasty as I'd like, much better with super hot horse radish - creamed spinach was good - creamed corn was good - Yorkshire pudding was bland, should really be made with tasty fat like bacon fat or sausage fat to give it some flavor - mashed potatoes were okay Overall: I had a good time but thought the food was okay good.  It's not that expensive for a place that serves that much meat.  Inclusive of sides it's less than $50/person.  You'd be hard pressed to find that at any other steakhouse or nice restaurant that serves 10 oz of meat. ***TIP: no seconds on the small City Cut*** I asked about cut size and the waiter said the City Cut is about 5 oz, which is way below average small, but said they cut them big so you will get about 7 oz.  In any case, it was enough to feed me.  A guy may want to get the medium Prime Rib cut which is 8-10 oz (plus a couple oz of seconds).</review>

	<review>I was honestly disappointed.  Maybe people hyped it up for me too much?  I don't know but, I just wasn't impressed.  I've had really good prime rib in LA, and this place just didn't compare.  Even worse than the prime rib were the sides.  We got the creamed spinach and mashed potatoes, but the spinach was so gross that we switched it out for corn, and even the corn wasn't that great.  I hate to say it when all the other yelpers are all about it, but I would never go back here again.</review>

	<review>Overrated. This place is not that good, the cream corn was probably the best thing I had that night... The prime rib had toooo much fat on it for me... in the end I had to chop off 1/3 of the meat due to over fatty-ness. I'm the type of person that don't like the excess fat. Ew. Not me. This place comes with complimentary corn bread that is also pretty good... Overall this place wasn't as good I expected it to be after hearing so many good things... I was let-down by the service and the food.</review>

	<review>I think "overrated" is the word I am looking for here. The meat was pretty tough and my jaw was getting sore from having to chew each bite of meat so many times. I personally prefer more tender meat in my mouth. Be gentle with me please, if you know what I mean. I will admit, the meat was juicy and wet though. I do like wet juicy meat in my mouth. Yes. You know there's trouble when the sides (creamed spinach, mashed potatoes) taste better than the meat. The staff here is pretty pretentious. We reserved for a party of 8, but actually had 9 show up instead. When we asked our waiter if he could accommodate one more, he sighed, rolled his eyes, and basically made it seem like I was asking so much of him. Seriously, how difficult is it to squeeze in one more chair and dinner plate into our table?! Pretentious prick.</review>

	<review>ok so wilson and i decided to celebrate our one year anniversary in san francisco. we decided to have a nice dinner and had made reservations at house of prime rib. right when we walked in, being a young couple, we got somewhat of some stares coming from some waiters. i didnt feel completely comfortable, much less welcome but i figure brush it off and lets EAT!! the salad: WOW!! excellent mix and flavor as well as a show. one of the best salads i've had but i warn you, dont stuff yourself from it, there is a lot more to come. the entree: decent tasting meat, good mashpotatoes, and good creamed spinach. it wasnt exactly how i was expecting it to be but it was decent, enough for what we paid for. one thing that really surprised me was that there is NO free refills and that the drinks are super small, smallest i've seen in any restaurant. wilson's five dollar coke, just three gulps and its all gone. would we return to this place? nah! been there, done that. it just didnt really meet our standards to actually make us go back.</review>

	<review>I was so excited to finally try this place, but sadly when it was all said and done I was disappointed. The prime rib was wonderful and I really have no complaints about it (If you finish your meat you get more on the house. What is better then that?). What was disappointing were the side dishes. I got the creamed spinach and baked potato with all the fixins. The spinach tasted like it was frozen spinach in a very plain cream sauce and the baked potato was just that, a baked potato. I mean they could try to wow me a little. I hate it when I go somewhere and feel like I could have made the meal myself. Their Yorkshire pudding wasn't anything to scream about either, my boyfriend's mom makes better in fact. I think Izzy's has better side dishes by far though I don't know if I could say their meat is comparable (It's been a few months since I have been there so I don't remember for sure). My best steak dinner in SF was at the ACME Chophouse. Their side dishes and meat were all to die for. Go there instead of HOPR and you won't be disappointed.</review>

	<review>The House of Prime Rib is a landmark in San Francisco, but to me, it is a bit of an annoying birthmark that you wish you could hide.  This well known place is commonly the place where there will be sightings of great Bay Area Athletes. But athletes tend to eat too much protein, so, logically, it would make sense to see them hanging out here often. I love good steak and I have been told by many friends that, the house of prime rib is THE place in San Francisco to eat steak.  If that is the case, I suggest that you do NOT eat steak in San Francisco, because the quality is average at best.  Why pay more for something that is average? I've been here twice, and despite, more or less, hating this place, I'll probably come here again because I will admit, the social environment is not bad.  It's a comfortable place to eat too.  For the most part. The interior has a warm dimly lit vibe that makes intimacy breathe in the air.   Then, reality sets in.  You will be greeted by the waiter as if a museum curator who has gotten a ph'd in how to describe the intricate details of a piece of cow meat. Big deal!  Meat is meat.  Why make steak such a complexity?  Simple.  To justify the reason for ripping off the customer.  So you order steaks under various English themes which I cannot recall now (like the Sir Lanceolot Cut, the Jubilee Cut or the Knights of the Roundtable cut or the Queen Victoria slice, I can't remember now..why would a place want to have an English Theme for a restaurant.  After all, isn't English food known for being bland?), and then, you are given no choice on the salad which is described as if angels have flown down from the Swiss Alps with vegetables only accessible by specialized rock climbers who, on a daily basis risk their lives to gather it up for the customer. When they bring it to you, they do all sorts of magic tricks, spinning into a cyclonic circle as if you need a physics degree to precisely spread the salad dressing into the perfect equilibrium in order to be assured that the salad is precisely flavored.  It seems to me that the owner of this restaurant must have been obsessed with the centrifuge concept he learned in his High School chemistry class. Here is the catch:  It's shredded ice berg lettuce, carrots, radish, beets and, ahem,  thousand island dressing.  Big deal.  This whole scientific process to serve something I could have purchased at McDonald's for $1.15??  Mildly preposterous on a perfect day is what I say! Ultimately, the steak is merely OK.  They walk about with this huge cart that looks like a cross between a VW Bug and a Charcoal Grill and they serve the meat as if this process makes it extra special. I ate it and to my surprise: it tasted like *sighs* steak. Here is the clincher.  After you receive your steak, about every 10 minutes a different person will come up to you and ask, "did you like the meat?"  They ask you this question so many times, that eventually, you will want to say, "NO!  I HATE IT! I HATE IT! I HATE IT! LEAVE ME ALONE!" After awhile, you will feel as if you are being stalked by the entire work force at this steak house.  Even at the valet parking, when you pick up your car, the person will ask you, "did you like the meat?" Don't you hate it when a restaurant's business model is based on eccentric obsessive-compulsive behaviour? The service was also a little too "passively interruptus" in that they often would barge in the middle of my intimate conversations every 10 minutes just to ask. AGAIN, "did you like the meat?" It got annoyoing after awhile. Last but not least, because they cook their food with butter everything's too heavy. You have to come here because everyone says it is great, but in the end, you'll realize that it's just a steakhouse that charges twice the price it should.</review>

	<review>Not happy.  When the BF and I decided to go to House of Prime Rib I was SO excited. I was envisioning prime rib and mashed potatoes in my head all day, and I kept on visiting their website to decide which side I wanted (creamed spinach or corn) and which cut of meat (city or house?) By the time it was dinner time (we had reservations at 10:00 ): ) I was STARVING and SO EXCITED.  What had made me so excited about this dinner was because I had tried Lawry's in Los Angeles earlier this year and I absolutely LOVED it. The prime rib was so flavorful, and the yorkshire pudding was AMAZING. I seriously dreamed of Lawry's in my sleep... When I saw that HOPR was really similar to Lawry's, I knew I had to try it out. When we got to HOPR we were seated promptly, and the waiter came and took our order. Maybe it was because it was so late, but the waiter wasn't very polite, and he kept on picking at my BF ): Also, I was watching another waiter make the spinning salad for another table and I was impressed by his spinning technique (haha). However, when our waiter came he barely spun the salad and he didn't add all of the things the other waiter added. Anyways, when our prime rib arrived I was so disappointed. The prime rib was almost cold, and it wasn't very flavorful. On top of that the yorkshire pudding wasn't very good either, because the au jus it soaked up was crappy. Anyways to sum the whole night up, I had a less than friendly waiter, and a disappointing meal. Next time, I think I'll go to Lawry's in Los Angeles to get my prime rib fix instead.</review>

	<review>This place is an institution in San Francisco.  It's for eating one cut of meat carved table side.  And its all you can eat.  So if you wanna throw down the $40 entry fee to get some cuts of fatty meat, then you might dig it here.  But really, aside from the Yorkshire pudding, it's got all the makings of a trucker stop on I-10 that sources better meat for their buffet.   And I totally don't get the overdressed and soggy salad they bring you with 'their special seasoning' which for all accounts is pretty much Old Bay.</review>

	<review>I had greater hopes and expectations from such a landmark restaurant in the city such as House of Prime Rib.  We didn't have reservations, but getting them around the holidays was problematic to begin with.  My hopes were raised when I called and was told that they always have a couple of walk-in tables available... Our first experience felt more like a cattle call than a fine dining experience.  We arrived at 400pm which evidently wasn't early enough for a Sunday, Dec 23rd dinner and proceeded to wait among the masses near the bar for another 90mins.  We grabbed 4 seats at the bar where they are more comfortable serving vodka and ginger ale than a Moscow Mule, and where the ladies order Cosmopolitan's instead of a classic dry martini like wifey did.  When we were finally called to be seated, we walked past people who were still waiting with drinks in hand that had spilled over into the hallways of this sectional dining room establishment.  The ambiance is that of a Ye Olde English abode, yet inescapable touristy casual feel to it.  We were seated in the back in a booth where I instantly felt detached from the rest of the restaurant... The menu is somewhat fixed so there aren't too many decisions that needed to be pondered over.  You have your choice from several cuts of prime rib that vary mostly in size, cut, and doneness depending on where they carve from the slab of meat  that is wheeled around http://www.yelp.com/biz_…,  although it was a little too tight for the chef to maneuver such a cumbersome carving cart into the corner where we were seated, so any such feature such as tableside carving that was meant to be part of the dining experience was lost.  Between the four of us, one of us had the 7oz City Cut http://www.yelp.com/biz_…, another had the 11oz House of Prime Rib Cut http://www.yelp.com/biz_…, and two of us had the bone-in 16oz King Henry VIII Cut http://www.yelp.com/biz_….  I didn't know it at the time but you can have seconds on anything.  I'm not saying that I would have ordered The City Cut just to save 5 bucks, but I was shocked that it turned out to be the only cut that evening that wasn't too tough or stringy near the bone.  I know we all asked for medium-rare temperature but it was really chewy along the bone;  only the cap portion was tender.  This alone was the biggest disappointment of the evening, that the quality didn't live up to the reputation... Their spinning salad came off as a cheesy attempt to impress, but I thought it was over-dressed and a little soggy http://www.yelp.com/biz_….  The balance between the ingredients was uneven -- lots of beets, not enough hard boiled eggs, and where was the watercress?  The creamed spinach was super peppery in taste as two of us had noted.  The creamed corn was better but uninspiring otherwise http://www.yelp.com/biz_….  The mashed potatoes had a watered down texture, but the baked potato was good with a myriad of condiments that you can add like butter, sour cream, chives, and bacon http://www.yelp.com/biz_….  The sourdough bread was warm and tasted good with the butter http://www.yelp.com/biz_…, and the bread pudding was thin and toasty, different... The portions are huge and I might have been tempted with another cut if the meat wasn't so stringy and tough.  It was as unsatisfying a meal as I've had in recent memory, especially for how much you pay for prime rib, I half jokingly say that Sun Wah Que had a better plate of prime rib when we grew up.  I felt poorly for our server David because it wasn't his fault that we had to wait for two hours and the food was mediocre... Take my advice, put on a Jacket and walk down a block to Harris' Restaurant on Pacific where their meats are a better quality...</review>

	<review>I ate at HOPR last week with five other friends.  It was extremely busy, but we had early reservations and were seated promptly.  Our group of 6 was seated at a table that could really only accomodate 4.  As food and drinks arrived, things were constantly being shuffled to make room on the table.  I was seated at the end, with my back a foot or two from another diner.  Unfortunately, this was an aisle for all the wait staff in the room, but it wasn't wide enough, so I was constantly being bumped.  I moved as close to the table as possible, but this did not help, so I moved back, but the wait staff just squeezed through, bumping me even more and giving me the stink eye for taking up too much room.  It was a very frustrating evening. If you're looking for ambiance, go somewhere else.</review>

	<review>I'm not sure if this restaurant is just too overrated and can't live up to the hype or I just don't have that fine taste to appreciate good expensive meat. Fiance and I went here for my birthday. We made a reservation a month ahead and got a slot on a Sunday at 5.30pm. I've been wanting to try this place out for the longest time so I was excited and really looked forward to the dinner. On the day, we came in and they sat us at the bar area. The decor was pretty old school and the crowd was kind of older crowd but that was irrelevant to the star I'm giving for this restaurant. After 10-15minutes, we got seated to our dinner table. My first thought was "you must be kidding me...". The tables are so close together, I can easily elbow the guy sit next to me. The dining room is loud cause the tables are so close together and the voices just got echoed by the wall. For the price that they are charging us, they really can afford to lose few table in there. The first thing that came was the bread. One word. Meh....... Then comes the salad show performed by our server. Notice I said salad show and not salad. That's because watching the server spinning the salad bowl is more worthwhile than the salad. Blech.. Then comes our prime rib. It is not hot!! It's just lukewarm. All the sides was just ok too. Cream of spinach was a bit salty. Cream corn taste like corn and cream... Baked potato was pretty good. Mashed potato was horrible. yorkshire pudding was interesting, but not awesome. Honestly, nothing impressive. None of them makes me want to come back to HOPR. The only reason they get 2 stars from me is because of my free birthday ice cream scoop and the free pictures they gave us.</review>

	<review>Omg!!! Had reservation and still waited too long to be seated. Host who seated us welcomed us with, "you have the best seat in the house". Omg!!! It was the worst seat in the house! It was half a table, half a booth.  The food was good and the waiter tried to make the best of the situation.</review>

	<review>2.5 STARS The House of Prime Rib did not live up to all the hype and rave. As a matter of fact, I was very disappointed with my experience. I made reservations well in advanced for a party of eight. We arrived on time and were seated at a six person booth, which means that they added two chairs at the end of our booth to fit our party. Our area was pretty cramped, but we managed. The majority of our table went with the House of Prime Rib Cut, while I went with the English Cut. I wanted to try something different, so the thinner cut I went! The English Cut was much thinner than the thick HOPR Cut, but the flavors were more concentrated. The flavor was okay, but the meat was on the chewier side and not at all tender. The sides were no bueno too. Each plate was served with a side of mashed potatoes or baked potato, corn bread, pudding, and creamed spinach. The sides were boring and overly salted. This place is overrated and I wouldn't recommend wasting your time here. I've had prime rib that cut like butter before and this place was not at all comparable. The service wasn't great either. One of our servers (serving the corn bread) could not reach one of our plates, and instead of politely maneuvering to set the corn bread down, he simply tossed it a few inches with his tongs. Yeah, enough said.</review>

	<review>Dined here on sunday 6/3 for a special occasion we got seated at around 7:30 which was nice since we did not have a reservation until 8pm. We started off with a nice bottle of pinot we chatted and really enjoyed ourselves. We then ordered our food and the salad came which was just as good as it always is... From there the Prime Rib came out and this time it just was not all that great, I have had many dinners here and this time it was just way off  to top it off our waiter was wondering about helping everyone but us. The final thing that pushed me over the top was the baby in the backroom crying for about 30 mins straight I know family like to dine out as well but if your child is crying and throwing a fit for 30 mins straight its time you take them outside and get some air. Being I was not all that impressed with my first cut of prime rib I asked that waiter to bag the bone (which my dog throughly enjoys) when the waiter did come back with seconds it was one very thin slice of prime rib at this point I just wanted to leave so we settled the bill and left. For the price Im paying here I can go elsewhere and definitely enjoy my meal. BYE BYE HOPR.</review>

	<review>I just had THE MOST DISAPPOINTING dining experience ever. And we were celebrating our engagement. And it was my birthday. First let me say that House of Prime Rib is MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT EVER. I've been a long time customer for many years now and have always had a wonderful experience that always enticed me to keep coming back... until the other night. 1) My reservation was at 8:00pm. So why didn't I get seated until almost 9:30? I understand it's probably peak dinner time but what's the point of a reservation if I have to end up waiting an hour and a half for my table? Not a great way to start the evening. 2) Service. My bf and I always order the King Henry Cut to share. Perhaps I've been spoiled because although we requested that we were sharing, they've always provided two of everything- two salads, they would carve the meat and provided two separate plates, two separate sides, etc. But this time, when the carver came around and our mouths were salivating at the thought of digging into our prime rib, we didn't receive two of anything. We basically received one slice of meat, and an extra (empty) plate. In an attempt to "share my plate", I had to cut this big fat piece of meat in half with a very dull knife and place it on my bf's plate (and I am no professional carver). I had to basically slide my mashed potatoes off my plate and pour au jus onto his plate with a fork (no spoons provided). I am spending major bucks by ordering the most expensive item on the menu. If I knew I had to do the hard work and plate the items on my own (which I've never had to do before), I would've just ordered two separate entrees so that I wouldn't stress myself out trying to play kitchen at the dining table. 3) No seconds? Whenever we order the King Henry cut and share our plate, we are allowed to get seconds. This is no secret. We are not special. It's just the way it's been. So this time we asked for seconds and the waiter says that seconds are not allowed for shared meals. I STRONGLY DISAGREE. We asked, "Is that something new because we've always been offered and allowed second". He says it's the way it's always been since he's worked there (although I highly doubit it cuz I've done it) and he says he can ask the manager. We politely ask him to ask the manager and I seriously doubt he asked the manager because he came back with the same lame speech. Any manager in their right mind would have came out to tell us No in person or would have made a one-time exception. Once again, I've been here MANY times, shared a plate, and had seconds. I expected to stuff myself into a food coma. If I had known I would be denied seconds like we've always had, then we would have ordered separate meals. Instead we had to share 1 plate and left unfulfilled, unsatisfied, and hungry. I hate you HOPR. And it was my birthday. .</review>

	<review>This place is overrated. I was disappointed the first time I went there for dinner. Service was great. The food -- house salad and the prime rib -- was a huge disappointment. The first time a friend treated. The second visit did not change my opinion of this restaurant with nice, aged decor.  Not a good value for your money.</review>

	<review>Update: DO NOT GO UNLESS YOU CAN SECURE A BOOTH!!!!! I specifically requested one in my reservation, but sure enough, we were seated in the middle of the dining room at a table right next to a loud party of five. And by seated next to, I mean my boyfriend kept bumping elbows with the guy at the other table. I was appalled. For all the excellent attention to detail and flourish the waiters posses, the host appears to be an asshat. No one should ever sit in that seat. It almost ruined our hundred dollar meal. Which is not something I'm not easily ready to forgive. However, then the food showed up. And the food was SO damn good (ALL the food, from the pudding to the bread to the beef). But I was so appalled that our request was ignored (that, and our table was in such a bad spot it shouldn't have even existed in such an establishment). Two stars, HoPR. And a FAIL stamp. INSIST ON A BOOTH!!!!!!! Also, be warned, both times we went, we showed up just a little over on time for our reservation, and were still forced to wait half an hour in the lounge. Am I the only one who feels that if you pay more than 100 dollars for a meal you should get the service you are, well, promised? Am I just a cheapskate?</review>

	<review>The waitress admitted to her friend, while she was making our salad next to me, that "This is what happens when I don't get my nap!" She stated something about being sleepy, being super out of it, etc etc. Lady. Come on. I'm not paying this much to hear you complain. Thus, all of her efforts to put together a show for us seriously looked half-assed. Thank you very much for making my night so special. + Good bread. + The portions were uber large. + This old man walked around asking everyone how their meal was. That was nice. - I don't like my salad drowning in dressing. - Our ribs came out hardly warm. What happened?? - I wish there had been a little more space. Everything felt really crowded. - Took away our water and never replaced it. - Everything just tasted really salty. Salty creamed spinach. Salty Yorkshire pudding. Perhaps I'm just not one for cured meat. (I went home and seared my leftovers later on which turned out pretty good..) Or it could have been because nothing at the time could beat out the fantastic dinner I had had the night before at Marica's in Oakland. Who knows. Wouldn't go back to HOPR out of my own accord.</review>

	<review>So my partner and I love to travel up to Ashland Oregon for the Shakespear Festival.  along the way at approximately the half way point there is a casino directly on Hwy 5 at Corning.  They have a $15 all-you-can-eat casino buffet complete with Prime Rib.   I read the menu at the House of Prime Rib.  I read everything about the quality of the beef and the salt packing etc.  I think that my casino prime rib is every bit as good for $15 I really wanted to like this place.  I didn't hate it but I wouldn't go back.  It was well priced compared to other steak houses (e.g. Ruth's Chris, Harris').  The atmosphere was kitchy but fun.  We had a reservation yet still had to wait in the bar for nearly 1/2 hour.  The service really, really tried to be friendly but they were so stressed that it was hard to pull off.  It seemed to us that there were 10 buspersons standing around with nothing to do and 1 waiter stressed beyond belief as it appeared that she was covering the whole room. Overall a disappointment.  Not that it was horrible, but in San Francisco you can do so much better for your money.</review>

	<review>I went here with a couple of friends mid week. The prime rib was tender and tasty.  Food = 4 stars. The service was awful.  Service = 1 star. We checked in before our a reservation time. We were seated 20 minutes after our set reservation time. It took the waiter at least 10 minutes to get us water. The waiter was not very attentive. He messed up on the side dishes that we ordered. The overall service detracts from the restaurant.</review>

	<review>This place has cut too many corners recently. Service was poor (the waiters were singing as they went into the back - we were sitting near the service entrance even though I had made reservations a month out). Our waitress dropped the check on our table with one hand and our dessert with the other. And just little things, like swapping out the sugar cubes for packets for coffee, and the use of beat up water glasses and small wine glasses......it doesn't have that fancy-night-out feeling anymore. I won't be going back, and I've been an avid fan for the past 10 years.</review>

	<review>At the risk of getting hate mail from those 5-star fanatics out there, I was not impressed by HoPR. In fact, I was incredibly disappointed. I'd wanted to eat here for years and finally went for a family birthday dinner. It's a good thing my family doesn't read these reviews, because they'd be pretty crushed to know they spent so much money for me to have such a forgettable meal. Sure, the cart is classic and all that, but this was probably the most tasteless piece of prime rib I've ever eaten. Maybe it was an off night, but I see no reason to ever go back here. And to all you out-of-towners, I'd save my money and go elsewhere unless you're more into flash than substance.</review>

	<review>Gist:  Totally disappointed after reading all the rave reviews.   Meat was stringy and plates were messy.  If you get the chance, try Lawry's Prime Rib (Dallas, LA, Las Vegas, and Chicago).  Same setup and service, yet food is so much better! Hubby took me here for my birthday, bless his heart.   I've been telling him I wanted to try House of Prime Rib (HOPR) because of all the rave reviews here and positive recommendations from my friends.   I LOVE prime rib.  And maybe coming from Texas, where beef is king, I've been spoiled.  But I think not.   San Francisco knows how to cook! First things first, we came on a Sunday at 6:30 and it was busy.  They were about 10 minutes late in sitting us despite our reservation.  A little annoying, but no biggie I guess.   The Good: The best thing about HOPR is the menu.  It's so easy to order.  Pick a cut, and everything else comes with it.  No worries about how much the side dishes cost.   Its kind of fun seeing the carts meander through the restaurant and prepare the plate right in front of you.    I also really enjoyed the salad which is prepared at the table as well.  The dressing is yummy unique vinaigrette and probably can't find it anywhere else.   The Bad:   The meat!  Husband got the HOPR cut and I got the English cut.   Everything looked good at first.  Prepared as requested - medium rare, pinkish.  But actually chewing the meat was another matter.  The meat was super stringy and difficult to chew.  Prime rib is my favorite cut of meat.  I know its not supposed to be like this.   We were poking at our teeth the entire trip home!   I thought the seasoning was a little bland.  I basically felt like I was eating a regular roast beef.   The season salt they have at the table shows MSG in the ingredients list!   No thank you. The worst part of all was was how difficult it was to cut my meat.  It should have been easy since I got the thinnest cut, but it was such as challenge as the mashed potatoes had become watered down by the gravy and it was all around and under the meat.   Its very difficult to pick up watered down mashed potato on a plate.   And don't forget the mounds of horseradish that was dolloped on top everything.  As it melted and spread everywhere like the potatoes, every bit was a roller coaster ride for my nose.   This downfall can easily be remedied by simply putting the side dishes in separate little bowls just like they do when you order a baked potato.   I feel a little out of place posting such a mediocre review amidst all these 4-5 star reviews.   Honestly I cannot compare HOPR to any other prime rib in San Francisco, as I haven't found any.  Maybe this really is the best in the city (the only?).  If that's the case, I'd rather save my prime rib appetite for another restaurant out-of-town.</review>

	<review>After the IDF (Intel trade show) a colleague of mine, along with myself and my gf decided on steak. Of course what do we choose? House of Prime Rib... So we get there and as expected, the waiting area is full of tie-n-coat people (most who were probably also at the show). After requesting a table for 3 the host asks us to wait in the general area and we'll have a table in 20 minutes. 20 minutes pass, no table. So we politely go to the host and ask for an update. "They are preparing your table and we'll call you as soon as its ready." 20 more minutes pass, and still no table. By now, the waiting area is empty. You can guess that we are very suspicious of HOPR's customer service at that point, so we decide to ask once again. The host informs us that they are preparing our table (does it take 20 minutes to prepare a table?) and that (you guessed it)... "we'll call you as soon as its ready." We finally have a nice waitress come and get us (45 minutes later) and seat us at a booth near the kitchen area. I would like to note that there were several empty tables. So I am left wondering, did the host have a bad day or something? To cut a long story short, the salad was spectacular (I've only eaten here once before and I can say that both times, the salad actually stole the show), although the steak was cooked exactly as requested, with a nice texture and an inherent juiciness you always feel with a quality steak. Of course the waitress was quick on service and very pleasant; all of the above are the only reasons that I did not give this establishment 1 STAR. Now if only they could hire a host with some manners... if I were the general manager I might have had the host fired on the spot or given a huge reprimand.</review>

	<review>I'm rating this place solely on customer service! Called to make an appointment for my husband who has heard of this place and has been deployed, he wanted to eat here with some friends and family when he got back. I called to make a reservation for 12 adults. The person who answered the phone said that on the weekends they only do reservations for up to 10. So I asked him nicely if he would make an exception for us because my husband was coming home from deployment and we wanted to surprise him for dinner at house of prime... And this guy told me " WE DON'T MAKE EXCEPTIONS FOR ANYONE!!"  He didn't apologize or said that it was their policy that they can't do that! I was just blown away at how rude this guy was!! So I just want to let all the military families and friends out there that this place is not that good for our soldiers to eat at if they can't accommodate TWO extra seats for out troops!!!</review>

	<review>I've been eating at House of Prime Rib for special occasions since I was a kid. I've probably eaten here 40 times over the years, but I don't think that I will EVER GO BACK after what happened at my Uncle's birthday dinner last night.  So we had a group of 5 and half of the group were vegetarians.  We ordered wine and cocktails and had a high bill for the amount of people. The waitress decides to add on about $25 worth of extras, because my aunt shows up at the end of the meal and literally takes one bite off of my uncle's dish.  They don't notify us at all, and just decide to pad the bill since someone else sat down at the table. The side dishes of the vegetarians were almost as expensive as prime rib dinners!  So the manager comes over, and literally gets in a fight over this!  I thought restaurants were about hospitality???  And to top it off, we ordered desert, and they never brought it to us.  I am sorry, but the management is horrible at this establishment. So bad I will never go back. We had a $350 bill, and could have had a much happier experience elsewhere. I know you have a full restaurant day after day, but you really need to think about how you treat your customers.</review>

	<review>I wish I could give them zero star! Although their service was getting worse every time we dined there, this was one of our favorite restaurants before. Our last visit will be the real LAST one. How they could do all of them in one evening? Plus food poison almost killed us for next few days! We were there for our anniversary and some other family celebrations - as others mentioned, reservation time was ignored.  We had to wait at a bar area forever. No employees knew when we'd be called. The area was too noisy especially with one table with drunk people of about 8. They were not only too loud, kept talking sex with nasty gestures. There was no way to avoid catching every word as they never stop talking. Other customers had to raise their voice as well or they couldn't hear each other. We were with kids, my husband asked if the restaurant could find a quiet (or at least with decent people without talking about sex) area they refused to help us. It's because those customers are here to enjoy the evening. Sure! You are right. And then? What about us? Aren't we there to enjoy the evening as well? They put us there and would call us whenever our table was ready. Hello? We gave them our reservation name, don't they have it? Are they going to call us something like "table #1, go to the dining area".  Even Denny's knows how to address their customer! We have had enough of their nasty "conversations", my husband was about to stand up to stop them. There was a brave lady saw him and gave him a gesture "I'll do it". She really did a great job for her party, for us and the rest of waiting customers. The nasty group showed her "great" attitude and restaurant ignore the actions. She started talking to them calmly but they responded with nasty words. Her party moved to another area in the waiting space. The group of nasty people kept following her and her company. My husband was ready to help her if she was physically in danger. The group made fund of her with fingers, her appearance, accents and the members in her group. She was so patient while their personal attack didn't affect other members in her group. When they threatened one of her friends, she warned the person. The restaurant took full advantage of her words and used the moment. She was pushed (yes! physically) by a male restaurant employee. It was obvious, she just lost her physical balance with the unexpected action by him. He cursed and immediately kicked her out from there. It gave the nasty group wrong message - she lost &amp; they won - the restaurant fully supported the drunk group! Why? The drunk party has more people (more $ for the restaurant) than hers? Her party looked "poor" and didn't deserve the high-end (yeah, better than Denny's...) dinner? People with colors can't talk to rich white people (the drunk party was with all white)?   The restaurant was wrong!!! I wanted to cancel our reservation (we already waited too long!) and go somewhere else. My husband almost agreed but we all, especially our kids, looked forward to the dinner, we decided to stay --- Stay... It took another long time to be seated in the dining area. We could talk with other customers about the situation. Yeah! All of us had plenty of time to talk - This was the only benefit of fucking long wait time. We agreed the restaurant was wrong! When we seated at our table, it was already too late. Our kids were tired of waiting and almost fell asleep. So we were. It was a way passed dinner time, our appetite was completely gone, not in the mood to have some wines and dinner. Their dinner was prefixed. Salad with performance - we were not in the mood to enjoy. Potatoes, pudding, whatever and too cold red meat... We just cut food into bite size and put them in our mouths. Dessert and pay. No surprise! Each took too long. Photo for our anniversary - no thank you! We didn't remember much of the food taste. Just got bad time and too tired. We didn't hear "thank you" or any words from any of their employees. I guess they had bad evening with the drunk party. They occupied both men's and lady's rooms. Other customers' rest room use was extremely "limited". The restaurant deserves it! They kept the drunk party - already too drunk at waiting room, more with dinner. You know what happens then. Haha! By the way did the restaurant serve us raw meat? We ALL got food poison. The rest of our 3 days weekend plans were canceled then. We went to an ER late in the night then stayed at home. We really should leave when we saw the restaurant's wrong treatments to the right customers!</review>

	<review>The House is living off a reputation that has seriously declined over the last several years.  This use to be my favorite restaurant for decades.  Now, the cramped tables, the extremely high noise level (can't hold a conversation), and the decline in food quality has eroded their rating.  And I seriously recommend that if you go there despite my recommendation to stay away, that you do not order anything other than prime rib.   A friend we went with ordered something else and got food poisoning, which they couldn't care less about.  If you want a quality restaurant for a special night, there are much better places to go with a better ambiance.  Don't go because of their reputation.</review>

	<review>Arrived just before dinner (7/30/12) was starving I have my wife and kids with me. We were in the area on my wedding anniversary I thought this might be a great place to enjoy that and hopefully some good steak. Even though we were the first to arrive for some reason we were the last to be served. That's my first time I don't think much of it at the time. They the steaks around in what appears to be portable oven, which I thought was pretty cool. Unfortunately that's exactly way our steaks arrived "cool", in fact they were cold! When I told the manager about it he basically acted like he was annoyed that I had a problem with getting cold meat! I have convinced the guy to replace the meet! Once we got replacements, they were cold also! Tried to get in touch with the owner, but no luck! I believe this was a good place once a time, but not anymore! I'll never go back!</review>

	<review>After this last experience, I'm left heart broken.  HEART BROKEN!  I've gone for years and the food doesn't disappoint, but a large part of the dining experience has to do with customer service and customer service starts the second someone calls to make a reservation.   Background: I need a venue that can accommodate 40 people for a 30th anniversary dinner. Expectation: I checked the website and it clearly states, "If you would like to book a party or large gathering, have your next special event at the House of Prime Rib.  Our Banguette Room seats 20 to 70 people." Actual Experience: I called to inquire about the Banquette Room and talked to someone claiming to be the reservations manager which was like talking to a robot.  He had no idea what the website said.  All he knew was that the largest group that they could accommodate was 50 people and only from Monday to Thursday.  No large groups on the weekend.  That was pretty much the end of the conversation.  No "Sorry" or anything even remotely apologetic. My thoughts:  Are you serious???  First off, how many special family events that warrant a guest list of 40 people are planned for a weekday?  Second, business must be so good that they can afford to turn down a party of 40 people and not even sound apologetic about it. Recommendations:  HOPR, train your staff to sympathize with customers even if your inane rules prevent them from accommodating the customer.  Update your website to reflect your inane rules so as to manage expectations.   Never in a million years would I have expected this type of service from HOPR, but I guess times change and all good things must come to an end.  I guess I'll just have to move on...and take my family and friends with me.</review>

	<review>Wow, what a birthday experience my boyfrind took me to HPR thinking I would love it as I am a massive meat eater.  You walk in and are stuck in a Twilight Zone episode and not a clean one.  The waiter for the duration on the night realistically spent less that 5 min with us and expected at lease a 30% tip for what?  Making a crude spin salad, having us overhear the bitch bartender say to customers : Fuck off I am not hear to make new friends" and just plomping down meat on a plate. ABSOLUTELY CRAZY ENSUES.  A man at the bar decides to call the long hair homely bartender that has been there for over ten years a real nut... he tellls her "you know what they ought to roust your ass out of here you hate your fucking job and think all these old people are nazis. AMEN</review>

	<review>Never again!!!! I just came back from the most embarrassing treatment I have ever been subjected to. My fiancee and I came in about an hour and a half ago 5:00pm 10/13/2012. We sat at the bar because the wait was over an hour and we were hungry.  She had the city cut and I had the English cut. Both cuts were uninspired, and rather salty and generally fatty. After an over marinated salad we tolerated the prime rib. I asked for the bill and the heavy-set youngish white female bartender asked us if we were out of money!!!! She then asked if we could afford some coffee or dessert. I was mortified. I will never come here again, and I will tell others of my experience. Next time I'll listen to my fiancee and go to Ruth's Chris. This place is over rated. Never again!!!!</review>

	<review>What restaurant has a policy that doesn't take reservations for a party larger than 10 Fridays to Sunday?   HOPR ... that's who!  I called one week in advance to make a reservation and was told that was their policy ... asked to speak with a manager, was placed on hold ... a few minutes later, the hostess came back and said that the managers were all busy.  HOPR may get their clientele based on their reputation, but their policies and practices leave a lot to be desired.  If you don't want my business, I will be happy to take it somewhere else ... Broadway Prime or Flemming's in WC or Palo Alto.</review>

	<review>first of all i had great expectations for this place. i saw this restaurant on no reservation. then to make sure this place lived up to its reputation i looked on yelp. i was ready to pay a visit.  i came in and asked for a table.but i didnt call in a reservation.  so they had told me i would need to wait 30-45 mins for a table. i was like sure why not. as me and my date sat at one of the tables in the lounge. we sat there for a abit and a waitress came by and asked if we wanted drinks and i was like what do you have. she goes and tells us to look at the drink menu.  i look and asked all you carry is wine?  she looks and says oh im sorry your missing the mixed drinks menu. as she went i decided to look at their bar. i was thinking thats it? it was very pathetic in terms of carrying whiskey. so i decided to try a mixed drink. why not a vodka martini. so it was a vodka martini made with belvedere and my date had a cosmo. i have to say it was the worst drinks i have ever tried. my martini tasted like it was rubbing alcohol. same thing with the cosmo.  as we waited for our table  time went by where it was longer than 45mins and people who we came before them got tables. i went up a few times to the guy who took my name to ask whats going on with my table. he never apologized to why its taking longer than expected it.  he looked like he was more annoyed that im ruining his fun flirting with another manager.  then they finally sat me down at a table after waiting for over an hour. of course i get seated in the worst seat possible behind the door in a super small nook .  of course at this point im like finally lets hurry up and get some food. i knew what i wanted and  waited for our waiter to serve us.  we ordered and waited for the salad. they make it a point to show off to show how great of a time your instored. it was a huge fail. im sorry but i hate soggy salads. the salad was wilted. not anywhere near fresh. the texture of the salad was soft and mushy.  i guess thats why the dining room is very dimly lit.  i barely eat 1/3 of it.  it was just disgusting. at least the big roll of the bread was good. i ordered the king henry while my date had the english cut. i ordered mines with the creamed spinach and baked potato while my date had the mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.  i was like finally the main course.  first thing i dove into was the creamed spinach. it was horrible. i dont know how they make it but when i tried it it tasted it like they used a roux to the creamed spinach. they didnt cook the roux all the way through and it made the creamed spinach very undercooked. thats what it seemed to me. but i can be wrong on how they made it. one way or another it was horrible. i was gonna be pissed if my prime rib was terrible. that was the only saving grace of the whole evening. the prime rib was cooked very well. i had it medium rare and it was medium rare. unfortunately i ate about a third of my prime rib and asked for it to be wrapped because i couldnt stand being in the cramped table any longer and the other terrible sides. the customer service was lacking. the only thing they didnt mess up was the prime rib, baked potato and bread. for the money i had spent i would recommend else where. this place is a joke. this would never pass in chicago.</review>

	<review>Last night my family and I went there. Had avoided the place after noisy poor service, I had hoped it had been a bad night. Unfortunately the tables were crammed together making the noise level unbearable and the prime rib was tough. The waiters were too busy you had to tackle them just to get the bill.   We are moving our loyalties to Harris steak restaurant.  Great prime rib.   Too successful for so long this restaurant is slipping</review>

	<review>How to get your ass 86'd out of HOPR: 1) Call 4 hours in advance of your reservation to ask if the restaurant is able to accommodate two extra people in your party, in which the restaurant tells you it's not a problem. 2) Show up promptly for your reservation with your party of 10 and wait. 3) Continue to wait over an hour for a table in which you had a reservation for, with nothing more than a "your table is almost ready" from the hostess. 4) Leave an honest review about your bad experience on Yelp. 4) Wait for a call from the owner telling you that your bad experience was all your fault because a member of his staff did not follow an unspoken policy of not being able to seat parties of 10 or more on a weekend. He will then tell you that you are no longer welcome at his restaurant and you will not be served the next time you decide to give his restaurant another chance to redeem itself. That's fine if the 10+ rule really was one of their policies and someone just didn't get the memo. Just don't blame your lack of staff training on a paying customer and telling them they are no longer welcome to your restaurant because they voiced their opinion about an actual experience on Yelp. Last I heard, Yelp's slogan is still "Real People, Real Reviews." Apparently, this "mysterious" policy is only enforced when you write a review with anything less than five stars? This party of 10 didn't seem have any problems being seated the same night and even wrote a glowing five star review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/… So much for constructive criticism. P.S. Came here a few years back and had no service issues with a party of 7. They even took a nice polaroid of us to keep.</review>

	<review>See my review from 4/27 for reference. Wow, so I get a call from HOPR today, telling me to never to come here again or they will refuse service. Instead of calling and apologizing, they do this. GREAT SERVICE HOPR!!!! I was expecting along the lines of "Sorry, please come back again and we will remedy this." Instead, here is how the call went... - Hi, I'm calling from the House of PR, how are you Good, thanks - So I see that you came to our restaurant and had dinner. Yes, I did - Who did you make a reservation with, because we are not allowed to seat any tables over 10 on the weekend. I don't know, I called and spoke with a male who said it would be no problem. - What time did you call? Around 4-5pm - Oh, so it was an in-house call. Well, no one is allowed to take any tables larger than 10. Okkk... Sooo... It's my word vs. his word then huh? Why would I lie? - Well, I just suggest that you do not come back here ever again. I will refuse service That's fine, there's hundreds of other restaurants in San Francisco that have better service. - Do not come back here, you will be refused. Seriously... did that just happen? For a place that prides itself on service, that is absolutely horrible. That guy that called me is lucky I didn't just go off on him and was actually being courteous. Now that was my 3rd of 4th time at HOPR, and obviously my last. But, I'm actually thinking of eating here in the next few days to see if they will know it's me. What's funny is that guy I spoke to (why didn't I get his name?!) said that he would post a comment onto my review. What do you really have to say that will make others think that I was in the wrong???? On a side note, how will you know if I come? Will you be carding everyone? Security? I can just check in AFTER I eat, or just not check in at all. Update - I called them back to ask who it was that I spoke with, it was actually the owner Joe Betz. I would just like to say thanks Joe, thank you for your poor service and poor representation of what I USED to think was a fine establishment. Sounds like you have way too much pride and need to get off your high horse. Also, thank you for reminding me that I have been "86'd" from your restaurant, that I live over 300 miles away from. That makes me super sad.</review>

	<review>Just got home from House of Prime Rib in SF.  I love steak, and prime rib is probably my favorite. I had to make a reservation 4 weeks in advance, which was OK.  Once we got there, they sat us at a tiny table stuffed behind another table in a corner.  There shouldn't have been a table in such a small space.  A chair from an adjacent table actually rested against our table.  I asked to be reseated, which they accommodated after about 10 minutes.  No problems there. The presentation of the menu was a sort of interesting.  They had "a small cut, a medium cut (which can be sliced in thin layers), and a large cut".  I finally asked how many ounces they were just to get an idea of what I'd be signing up for.  The large cut could have been 32 ounces for all I knew, but it was really a modest 16 ounces.  Then we ordered and were served our food.  OMG!  They should rename the place to House of Absurdly Overpriced Cafeteria Food. Actually, that almost seems too good. The food was pathetic. I couldn't wait to get home to brush my teeth and try to get the horrible tastes out of my mouth. FAIL. The prime rib was mediocre.  What was really just ridiculously low grade was the creamed spinach, potatoes, and salad.  How can you mess up these dishes so badly? I'll go ahead and comment on the atmosphere, although if the food was great I could get over the noise and cheesiness of the place.  But the food was not great, which made the decor and unbelievable noise level all the more annoying. I can't believe that a restaurant like this can survive in a city like San Francisco.  My guess is all the 5 star reviews were filed by tourists who think Red Lobster is fine dining.  I live in the East Bay and would never bring a guest here for dinner.  Too many other places in the City and surrounding areas to waste the money in a total dump like this.   I'd give it zero stars, but the review won't register unless I give it one.</review>

	<review>My parents were beyond excited to be experiencing what prime rib San Francisco had to offer. And even my (their only daughter and San Francisco resident of 4 years) powers of persuasion could not steer them in a direction beyond that of House of Prime Rib, which by reputation had intrigued my parents to even stretch what I believe to be beyond our budget and spend a night splurging on a decent cut of meat and a lovely old San Francisco atmosphere.  To our surprise, even without a reservation the host informed us it would be a 45 min wait, a small price indeed for what was sure to be an enjoyable meal with my family. We took our places in the lounge area, ordered a round of drinks, and enjoyed the "regal" ambiance. That ship sank quickly when, after an hour, we had still not been seated and not even been serviced beyond our first drink. When the wait became an hour an and a half I returned to the host to see where we were in the waiting order, he had said only one party was ahead of us and that it would be 10 minutes max. At this point the luster had worn away, our second round of drinks had still not appeared after 30 minutes, the waitress still was no where to be found, and our names had not been called. When the wait had reached TWO HOURS my parents, who were still after over $50 in drinks convinced they wanted to stay and enjoy a nice meal, had begun to become for the first time visibly irritated. We decided to cut our loses finally. LET ME SAY THIS, when we did decided to finally give up, a waitress could not present us with the check any faster, even asking for water took 30 minutes. We left embarrassed and regrettably without what I'm sure would have been a superb fine dinning experience.  I have never been so compelled to write a yelp review before going here, but I feel that since we live in an age where almost EVERYONE reads the reviews posted on yelp exclusively to see if a restaurant is worth trying, its my duty to say this.......BOTTOM LINE: This place showed absolutely no hospitality to a family passing through the city who's only wish was to experience a piece of San Francisco history.</review>

	<review>I made a reservation with them for my fiance's birthday dinner.  I made the reservation on Tuesday for a Sunday night.  They were heavily booked, but said that they had an opening at 5:30 or 9 pm.  I said 9 pm would be way to late, and asked for the 5:30.  No problem!   Then I get a call on Friday telling me that they are confirming my reservation at 9pm.  That's not correct I explain.  How can they fix it I ask.  Their answer:  We can't.  Nothing.  I ask to speak to a manager.  No one is available.  I ask to speak to ANYONE higher up.  No one is available. TO be clear: I have no idea if their food is first rate, or their kitchen full of rats and cockroaches.  I do know that they have some serious problems with their reservation system being unreliable, and that it may have ruined my fiance's birthday dinner.</review>

	<review>I have to agree with others that this place is resting on its laurels.  I'm not quite willing to say to avoid completely even though this is a 1*, but I would definitely read recent reviews prior to making a reservation. The prime rib was REALLY good, but you gotta order it rare with thin slices. The rare piece my better half got was a bit better than my medium rare big bone, which was a tiny bit off and a tiny bit overcooked in several areas. Sorry, but I was looking for perfection. I suspect I really liked the MR meat due to the sauce rather than the meat. I only order rare from places like Sizzler because they tend to overcook medium rare and I rather have rare than medium. The pudding was forgettable. The creamed spinach did not taste right even though I love creamed spinach. The baked potato was nothing special. The loaf of bread was super hot, but nothing else remarkable about it. I tried the second serving, and it was bad (read: overcooked to medium). The seating took too long with a late night reservation. It still took 45 minutes. That would not be so bad if I didn't spot a couple that just walked in through the front door got a table within 3 minutes instead of the four groups of us sitting at the bar. The maître d' said they came at 7:45pm and I didn't spot them for 40 minutes??? I've heard of much better lies. I don't like being lied to.  We didn't get a free drink or anything of value for such a long wait. I think this place could use new management and a big overhaul. Sad because the prime rib is actually really good.</review>

	<review>Okay, the  food is good, BUT... they totally messed up a surprise birthday by telling us  that we never made adjustments to our reservations. We did make the adjustments, and we even called a month ago to get them done. It's not like the adjustments were made online, we gave them a ring and they still fowled up the guest numbers. Tragic!</review>

	<review>Ok, I'm in from out of town and 10 of us show up for a surprise birthday party that my best friend has been obsessing about the details and the number of people attending. So when we showed up with our entire party the hostess was a rude bitch that only had a reservation for 6.  Worse, she had the nerve to say the problem was our problem and not the restaurant. Who does that?  We totally confirmed 10 people. We ended up staying for food because what else would we do at this point because we got totally screwed. The only nice thing I can say is that the food was OK. A bit overpriced for me personally but I won't be returning to this place. The service and way we were treated was just inexcusable.</review>

	<review>good for the food... terrible for the customer service. i made a reservation for the friday after thanksgiving for a surprise birthday back in october.  we made it online which maxes out at 6 people and called in the following day to change the reservation to 10 ppl.  everything seemed fine. when i called on a monday to just double check the reservation -- glad i did -- they said they only had it for 6 and that to accommodate, we could eat at 10 pm. the "reservationist"... yes, they actually have people whose only job is to take reservations... must be nice... Rochelle (sp?) had some of the worst customer experience I have EVER experienced. When I said that I had specifically made the reservation for 10, she fired back with "The reservation was made online." Which is why, I then explained, I had called the following day and spoke with someone to adjust the reservation... her response, "Well do you want me to cancel it or do you want 10 pm?" The only time she apologized was after I asked for her supervisors information.  Even then, one of the most classic responses... I said: "Clearly you are not that sorry, otherwise you would really try and help."  Her response: "I offered you 10 pm." don't worry... birthday saved... called another premium steakhouse (right on the embarcadero), explained what i just went through and they got me in at 7.30... even better.  the actual original time we had wanted at house of prime rib. thanks Rochelle for being such a peach that i will make every effort to make sure HoP never gets another customer from my circle of friends again... your managers must be soooo proud!</review>

	<review>I have been coming to T.H.O.P.R. my entire life, for occasions deemed "special enough" to enjoy their terrific meat, sides and desserts. It holds a place in my heart as one of the best quality meals in San Francisco. Tonight I went to celebrate my husbands 35th birthday. The service we received from "Gus" was beyond appalling. He was rude to the person serving our salad and to me personally. When I raised an eyebrow at how he was treating our server he crossed the table to ask what was the matter. When I calmly stated that he shouldn't talk to staff in such a manner he said that he had been in the industry for 61 years and what did I know. He then said that I was insulting him and left in a huff. The embarrassed waitress said that it happened all the time and "that's just how it is here". I was not only upset for the waitress, but for myself. I had been saving this place for a special moment, so it was my husbands first time here. I was sorry to have brought him, and would have now rather gone to Ruth's Chris instead. Not only will I not be back, but my family, friends and clients will be informed of the downturn in service, and be encouraged to go anywhere else. Depressing.</review>

	<review>For several years my husband and I loved this place. He requested that we have his birthday party there, so we and eight friends had a great dinner. Unfortunately, SEVEN of us got food poisoning the next day. When my husband reported this to the owner of the restaurant, he very rudely told us it was "not his problem" and denied it had anything to do with his restaurant. Really? Seven out of ten of us got food poisoning at the same time, and you're going to deny it? To make matters worse, the owner hung up on on us before we had a chance to reply. Unfortunately, we will not be returning.</review>

	<review>By far the worst service in the history of eating out!! I don't know if it was racial or age discrimination, either way my family and I waited two hrs before we were seated, and when we were, we were sat in the back corner. The salad was warm an wilted. Our food showed up an hr and a half after we ordered, and the food was cold. To say the least, if you must go here, go on a wed at about 2pm.</review>

	<review>Don't get me wrong, their food is okay, 3 stars, but their service is terrible, hence the one star. I would give it zero star for their if I was able to. This is not the first time I've been here. I come here a couple of times a year. Yesterday was my wife's birthday. I had made a reservation for 8:30pm a few days prior. We got there at 7:47pm and indicated to the host that we are here for our 8:30pm reservation. He acknowledged me and said that our table will be ready shortly. I figure 45 mins was enough time for them to get our table ready. Was really looking forward to our dinner. We stood there the entire time. So 8:30pm came and I asked the host when our table will be ready. He said that we are the next one and it should take a minute to get the table ready. Well, that minute turned into 25 mins and we still didn't get our table. There were a few other couples that came in after we did and were seated ahead of us. We were so furious that we left the place and headed out to Chinatown. I didn't know if it was because we were discriminated upon due to our ethnicity or the lack of professionalism on behalf of the host. Maybe he was too busy trying to make sure Larry Baer, SF Giants owner, was enjoying his dinner. Yes, I saw him dinner with his family. See him was a treat. Bottom line is that if you promised a reservation to your customers, you should honor that promise. Don't overbook your reservations and make your customers wait for over an hour. They need to rethink their reservation system. So unprofessional. I guess I will start going to Chris Ruths for my special occassions. At least I know they will also keep their promises on reservations.</review>

	<review>I came here for a friend's birthday. We decided to come here since the last time was about 10 years ago. Parking was atrocious. My friends and I went in first while her husband looked for parking. They refused to seat us because he wasn't there, so we ended up waiting another 30 minutes. It's their policy so it's understandable. I know this place is famous for their prime rib, but that's the only thing on the menu, which was ok since that's what we went there for. BUT, the prime rib was really disgusting. It tasted like the prime rib from a cheap buffet: pale in color with no taste and a rubbery texture. The creamed spinach was lacking in flavor. I really didn't care for the yorkshire pudding. All in all, I wouldn't come back again, EVER. There are many other restaurants in SF that serve better steaks. I would much rather go to Izzy's on Chestnut. They have a better selection of steaks and their prime rib is CHEAPER and TASTIER, as is their creamed spinach. Plus, their service is much better, even though parking is just as bad over there.</review>

	<review>I went with a group and was very disappointed with House of Prime Rib. I ordered the largest meal on the menu and got a really fatty peice of meat that was mostly bone and cartilage. I left hungry and unsatisfied, especially considering that I spent over $45 for the meal. The little scrap of meat I actually got was nothing special either. It wasn't tender or exceptional in any other quality. It was literally the same meal I'd get at another steak joint, but paid 2-3x the price. Highway robbery.</review>

	<review>Dude Yelpers, you need to try Lawry's.  House of Prime Rib just is a pathetic imitator. Pros: + Prime rib.  Tasty, but everything else was anywhere from MEH to TERRIBLE. Cons: - Yeeks, the elderly male host could not have paid less attention to us.  As he was leading us to our table, he stopped to chat with two tables, leaving us standing behind him for five minutes the first instance, then without half our table's menus the second instance.  As the first point of contact, the first impression that he made could not have been worse. - Terrible service.  Though none of us had been to HoPR before, the waitress did not bother to explain the menu, cuts, or how the dinner would proceed to us.  We saw her for all of 3 minutes throughout the entire meal. - Mediocre food.  Salad was way overdressed, and a poor imitation of Lawry's spun salad to boot.  Mashed potatoes with brown gravy were standard, creamed spinach was starting to turn brown from being overcooked. - Wine markup is RIDICULOUS.  A bottle of Clos du Bois (which incidentally was on sale at Safeway for $9 that week) was marked up to $40.   This place is not worth the hype, number of stars, or amount of patronage.  Avoid.  Save your money for a Vegas buffet or for a trip to Lawry's.</review>

	<review>Wow! I'm completely flabbergasted by the way the Restaurant Manager, Bernd handled my dissatisfaction with the service on Easter Sunday. He told me that he would call me back after my complaint, but he never did.   I was hoping that I would get an explanation and possibly give House of Prime Rib a second chance. However, when I called to speak with him, he indicated that he saw my review on Yelp and decided that my guests and I should go to Broadway Prime because I spoke so highly of them. This just goes to show that the House of Prime Rib does "NOT" care about their guests' concerns and would rather have you go someplace else if you don't like the way they treat you. I'm sorry to say, but I have honestly never been treated so badly at a restaurant in my entire life and would not ever recommend this establishment to anyone.  If I could give this place zero stars I would.</review>

	<review>We went to this restaurant because a few friends of mine heard it's a good place to eat and it was his birthday so we made a reservation figuring we would give it a go. The service is pretty bad. They took away my plate even when I was working on my food. I ate slowly since the food is over salted but I wanted to finish because the price tag is so high. When I said I wasn't finished they said everyone else was and took my plate. I asked if I could have a to go box since they took my food before I finished but they just said no, grabbed my food and threw it away. Some people like the way they cut the meat and the table service but the rudeness of the staff and the over salted, over priced food made me say, never again. In hindsight, they probably did me a favor by throwing away my food before I finished. I might have gotten sick from all the salt.</review>

	<review>Took my wife there to celebrate her birthday. HoPR used to be one of our favorite prime rib venues. We had a reservation at 5:30pm thinking that if we got there early, we should be ok especially since we wanted to get our 2yo home in time for his regular bed time. We sat and sat until 6:20pm before we got seated. The guy at the front even gave us attitude after we asked what was going on 2x. Why have a reservation if you are going to wait 50mins???  The food arrived, the salad was salty, the King Henry VIII cut was luke warm, and they forgot our drinks after asking twice. Absolutely unacceptable. The valet took over 15mins to get our car. We are never going back!</review>

	<review>Been patronizing HoPR since 1965 when I arrived in SF0 in as a foreign student.  The inconsistency in the service and food continues through the last two visits since 9/10.  A Polish waiter was hitting on a pretty youngguest of mine on one visit.  On the other, a Ukrainian(?) one of those Russian satelite country, waitress was pushing bottles of wine when my guests wanted varying beverages,i.e., beer, glass of wine, cocktails. On top of it all, I always want more of my favorite cream spinach which has not been as good as before.  Both time, it was gummy and gritty(bacon?)-and not creamy. Wonder what they use as a binder.  Should look for an another place to have PR, especially when friends come to visit.  They tend to want to return to HoPR, but will dissuade them or if I were the host, go to another  place.  Too popular for its own good, noisy and tables placed too close for comfort and enjoyment of your guests and dinner.</review>

	<review>ok so we make reservations 2 weeks in advance because this place was suppose to be AWESOME.Not True.We arrive shortly before the reservation and go to bar area and have a couple drinks.At this point all is good.Our table is now ready so we move to the table and we are greeted by a server(white male 30's) and he blows through some scripted speach.I asked him to repeat a couple things and he is totally pissed.We proceed to order and he continues this face paced BS.He does not come and check on us till the food is served and this continues.The food is OK at best but we deal with it.Read on as it gets better.So we proceed to wrap things up and end as we are done with dinner and desert.15 minutes go by and I have to flag down another server so we can get our bill.he returns with the bill and I was tempted not to leave any tip but we decided to leave 10%.We pay the bill and we are out the door getting into our cab and this idiot actually comes out looking for me.I notice and look up and he then gives me a dirty look and walks back in the place.The nerve thinking he deserved more of a tip.Here is a thought "do your job" .Anyway stay FAR FAR FAR away from this place.Way over rated and not even close to Mortons or Ruth Chris.Would of given zero stars but the bar folks were good so they deserve 1 star.I also sent an email to the store and never received a response.</review>

	<review>Okay. This is San Francisco. Think of what artistry and passion and love goes into a restaurant here. Restaurants that charge $20 for a plate of food.   a restaurant is a little workshop. raw materials come in the back, finished goods go out to the dining room. So the price you pay for something is directly related to the quality of the material used and the care and craft of its construction. So what the eff is this place? The service is excellent, the atmosphere is good and big restauranty in feel. So here is my complaint... $40 a plate for a slab of roast beef that is very ordinary, and sides that come from large industrial cans. Creamed corn, creamed spinach, that is prepared by opening a can and then heating up the stuff and then putting a small dollop of it in a little dish. Salad covered in thousand island dressing, orange colored mayonnaise basically, and then a slice off of a slab of industrial farmed cow. They serve you about $2-3 worth of food at their cost, with no interest in actually quality, running the old family dining room shtick to justify serving cafeteria level food. It is like paying $1000 for a knock-off Gucci bag. It does everything the real bag would do, the store you bought it at was fancy, and the sales people were extremely nice, and they have been there for sixty years, but no matter what, no matter how charming those distractions are, you still are getting ripped off by greedy hucksters, that don't know how to make a bag, or, in this case, serve real food.</review>

	<review>Bottom line: If you have ever been in a good steak house, don't go there. I'm from Dallas, so I've been to quite a few good (and great) steakhouses. This place is a dump.   If you want to be surrounded by people in sweatpants, or want to eat mediocre raw steak with soggy sides and straight-out-of-the-can gravy, than this your place. Otherwise, stay clear. Seriously, for $50 piece of meat, you can get way better meat almost anywhere.   Don't buy into any of the good reviews that other people post. They must be smoking crack.  I went there with my sis, and we were both disgusted.</review>

	<review>This place is a cheap imitation of Lawry's The Prime Rib which opened 11 years prior to the HOPR. They have imitated everything, the menu, the spinning salad with beets including the dressing, mashed or baked potato, creamed spinach or creamed corn oh and the yorkshire pudding.  Not only that but they even have a crappy imitation of the beautiful stainless steel meat carts.  They even give you a chilled fork with your salad...just like Lawry's!  The shame! The only problem is that the meal doesn't even come close to comparison with Lawry's, it just wasn't up to par. The sourdough bread was the best part of the meal.  The creamed corn, get this, was made using CANNED corn!  It tasted terrible.  The salad was okay but the supposedly chilled fork wasn't very chilled.  The meat was good but still no comparison.  The meat carts looked like something a grade schooler built in shop class with weld marks all over. I saw that someone said this is a formal dining experience.  Don't even think of wearing a tux or evening gown to this place or you will look extremely out of place.  There was a guy at the table next to me with a ball cap on backwards.  You'd think they would at least enforce the simplest of dress code rules but apparently not. Save your money and travel to eat at the real deal...Lawry's!!</review>

	<review>I really liked this place back a few years ago. The food was great, the price was reasonable. I went back with my girlfriend 11/20 Saturday night and the nightmare starts. First of all I used my concierge service to book a table (received the confirmation email), then I called the restaurant Wednesday before I arrived in SF and everything looked fine. I arrived at 7:50pm for my 8:00pm reservations and they said you don't have reservations here. (OMG WTF!!!) If that wasn't another problem, we didn't eat till 9:30pm and we basically waited for everything ( water, food, bill ).</review>

	<review>Been eating her for YEARS.  And have never had a bad waiter.  Guess what!  AARON is a little asshole and must be new to the that scene.  I think he's related to Gus, the old and close to death host.  Thank You Steve for saving the meal for me, though.  I am seriously considering never going back.  $200 later (my elderly uncles) and me.  I think it's time to have my prime rib at home where I can really put on a show.  Or go to Harris' who knows how to treat a guest and be elegant at the same time.  Unbelieveable.</review>

	<review>The service was not as great as I expected it to be, but they were quite busy, so somewhat forgivable.  As for the food, I will start with the sides.  The mash potatoes were bland, even with the gravy they provided.  The spinach was overly salty and the cream of corn was probably the most distasteful item on the plate.  I wish we ordered the bake potato over all the other sides we had.  The salad was actually the only dish I liked from House of Prime Rib.  It doesn't really matter which cut you get, because once you finish the first cut, you are given the regular cut which is something I have no idea on what to call it. The prime rib itself was bland with zero taste.  It took a third slice of meat for me to actually enjoy myself.  The third slice was tender and absorbed the prime rib sauce very nicely.  Unfortunately, it took 3 slices of meat to get to that satisfactory slice.  Overall, I am disappointed at the House of Prime Rib, but hey, no restaurant is perfect.</review>

	<review>I can't believe this place is getting such high ratings.  This restaurant is VASTLY over-rated! Bad signs- Reservation for four at 7 p.m.  Arrived early and were finally seated at 7:45.  We should have walked out at 7:30. When was the last time you ordered a bottle of wine and had to refuse it because it was undrinkable?  I can't remember the last time this happened.  But we had to send back TWO bottles that tasted like the wine had already gone through the horse!  Did the manager ask or comment on the fact that they had served bilge at 60 bucks a bottle?  No, he did not. Waiter had received no training.  In fact, I doubt that if he had ever eaten in a restaurant before, let alone worked in one.  It's kind of hard to screw up an order when there are only a few choices on the menu to select.  He managed to screw up all four of the orders. Unpardonable sin:  the meat was COLD and an incredibly poor cut.  Very stringy, tough, and lots of cold fat that could only be described as blubber.  And this is a place that specializes in prime rib?  Also, the food on the service table was also cold.  Cold mashed potatoes and cold creamed spinach = lousy food. The prices are unbelievably high!  For what?  Inferior food, lousy service, bad wine.  The ultimate insult:  after we paid the bill and were leaving the restaurant, they practically chased after us because they had forgotten to include the corkage fee for one bottle of wine that our friends brought with them. Please stay away from this complete rip-off.</review>

	<review>Not a fan. Got the table at 8:30, food finally came out at 10. WTF? 90 min? They gave us bread and some lame salad before that, whatever. I WANT MY MEAT. I ordered the small cut, and it was very small, yet it's about $31 something. I asked for medium, it came medium rare. and the presentation was not inviting, too rustic. Blah mash potatoes. The side of corn was nothing special. I go to Harris' a lot, and that place is still my FAVORITE steak house. For $31 something, you can get a bigger steak with better service &amp; food. Harris' got good appetizers (including my fave steak tartar), well...I don't wanna talk about Harris' here. I will never come to this place again, not paying a lot of money to wait 90 minutes for my meat and mediocre food.</review>

	<review>I called House of Prime Rib to make reservations for my son's graduation dinner.  Because it is a party of 12, I called a week and half early. The reservationists said that they don't make reservations for 12.  I said then you don't want my business.  She repeats herself, so I repeated myself and told her that I'm calling early so I can get reservations.  They only make reservations up to 10.  She said she would have to talk to her manager.  I'm put on hold for a couple of minutes to be told that the manager is not available.  I gave her my tel # and she asked for my email address.  I probably won't get a call but an email saying "sorry, no reservations!!"   If I get a call/email making my reservations, then I'll update this review... otherwise, I'm very disappointed with any restaurant that won't take large party reservations.  They could call me or I can call them before the date to confirm. Update:  Manager did call me back.  They only make reservations up to10 on the weekends...but they would if available from M-Th.  That sucks, how can you get family from all over the Bay Area together on a weekday!  I want to Thank Izzy's Steak and Chops.  They took my reservation.  They asked for my credit card #, but that's okay.</review>

	<review>I went sometime around the Christmas holiday with my family and had an unpleasant experience here.  We had a reservation and while waiting at a small cocktail table to be seated, three different people asked us if we wanted drinks in about five minutes.  We got moderately dressed up, but no one else was so I guess it's casual.  After being seated, I was in the way of all the servers so my chair was getting bumped and pushed throughout my entire meal.  When we mentioned it to the manager, he said there's normally no table there so it's inconvenient for the staff.  Er, what?  Why did you seat us here then?  The waiter overheard and then told me to just push back.  He was nice but that comment pushed me over the edge.  Ridiculous.  Their reputation for service at the table is very showy and quite a gimmick - doesn't help the flavor of the food.  The food was not bad, but extremely basic - meat, potatoes and veggies.  Nothing was hot when served and the prices were clearly set in response to their popularity, not their merit.</review>

	<review>This place disgusts me! I've had food poisoning not once but twice from this place. Bacteria infested food. The meat here isn't even good compared to Harris or Ruth Chris Steakhouse. I DO NOT recommend this place to any human being or rodent for that matter. Yuckos.</review>

	<review>I don't even want to give it a star at all because the fucking waitress didn't even let me get anything after secondsand first of the king Henry cut. I came here last time and they let me get thirds. Fuck the waitress this time.  Also, I didn't even start eating my dessert and the dumbass waitress gave me the check already. If I was the owner of HPR, I would firethe waitress right away. I'm so pissed including my party members right now. I'll never be coming back here again. I don't want to lie but the dessert was disgusting in every way, maybe because it only took around 3 minutes.  Just for all that, worst service ever!</review>

	<review>I haven't spent the time to YELP much and usually think to do it for good experiences, but OMG, I'm actually sitting in the living room to write this review while my family begins dinner.  I have never before been so put off by a receptionist.  I just called the restaurant to make reservations 4 weeks out to celebrate my birthday with my family.  It's been a long time since we've been there but I have fond memories of good food despite long waits.  At any rate, I asked to make reservations for a party of 13 on a Saturday and the receptionist explained that they don't take reservations for parties larger than 13 for weekends.  So I said, "our party actually consists of 10 adults and 3 children, does that make a difference?" And she replied, "yes, it does, kids take up space too!"  The tone of voice came across sooooo sarcastic.  I could feel my face color when I heard that.  I mean, I didn't know if they have booth seating that can squeeze in more people if the kids are small, etc.  There are many polite ways to answer and this was far far away from that.  So far away that I will never choose to dine here again.</review>

	<review>This place is a joke.  This place advertise itself to be good....but its a big illusion. My meat was not even cooked right, and my plate had nothing but grease. I say this is a cheap place, because they waitress had the nerve serve me my meat of course not cooked but nothing but fat! the bread was horrible. I understand that the bridge and tunnel (suburbs) people would like this place because it gave the feel of Denny's. Yes the service was cool to have the meat come in front of you, along with the salad.... i give it that, but hello you are prime rib place... lets get back to focus here. Never will go back</review>

	<review>The one star is based mostly on service than the quality of the food. HOPR is well known for prime rib, and it was nicely done, but that was the only good part of my HOPR dining experience. We had a party of 9, and since HOPR has a no seating until all guests are here policy, nothing really happened until we all got there. We waited a good 15 minutes before a server came to get us, and one guest was at the restroom. The hostess pretty much started counting the second she got there, and we let her know that one of our guests was in the restroom. Once realizing one of the guest is not there, even though she is just a couple feet away in the restroom, the hostess still said, "let me know when all of your guests are here," and walked off. Since we were pretty impatient at that point, we tried to get her to come back, and as we tried to explain that everybody IS physically here, she just said something along the line of "calm down, there's no need to be upset". It was like what the hell, how snobby. The salad was a little drenched in dressing.. it was sour. Also, I am not very impressed with how the salad was flung onto the plate.. the end result is a messy plate of salad, which does not correspond to the snobby attitude of the restaurant in general. When the corn bread arrived, one guest put hers on her bread plate. Then the servers came to clear the table, and one of them took her bread plate that still has the corn bread. She wanted it back, so I asked him, "can she have her corn bread back? Why did he take her corn bread?" and he just pointed in the middle of the table where the rest of the corn breads were, and said "she can have that," I answered, "But HERS is on that plate you took". And he said, "she can have that" again. This went back and forth for a couple more times until he finally gave her corn bread and bread plate back to her. Seriously, was that really necessary? When the prime rib arrived, the servers fumbled with the side dishes, confused with who is getting what.. which is a little annoying, but that's okay. The worst is when my stepmom didn't get her baked potato, I asked one of the servers for an extra one. He stared at me, and said something similar to "that's all we have. sorry. no...... no............," then after 10 more seconds, "what would you like with it?".. It is like, what kind of joke is that? It is a common joke done wrong.. and done at the wrong time. Furthermore, after all the plates are cleared away for tea/coffee. The server came around and asked who wants what and gave us cups. Everybody told him what they wanted, and when he came back with the tea/coffee pots, he pretty much went around and asked who wants what again. What's the point of asking in the beginning then? And throughout dinner, there was a guy sitting behind us at one of the booths. He was the 5th person at the booth, so he was on a chair in the little strip of hallway. That guy was talking really, really loudly the whole time. The restaurant was loud and hard to hear each other across a round table in general, and with this guy being obnoxiously loud 80% of the time made it even harder. I am really disappointed that such a snobby place did not make an attempt to tell this guy to quiet down in any way. This is the most disappointing dinner i have EVER had, and no, HOPR, I will not be visiting you ever, ever again. On the other hand, I really recommend places like Broadway Prime for high quality prime rib and friendly service.</review>

	<review>I went to The House of Prime Rib with my wife.  We are both well traveled and can afford and enjoy the finer things in life.  I made a reservation several weeks in advance.  As I entered The House of Prime Rib, I was told our table was not ready yet and to have a seat in the bar.  The bar as the whole restaurant was crowded.  I noticed there were two seats at the bar.  I appeared as the people had left because there was trash and empty glasses on the bar in from of the seats.  As we sat down, I was told by a loud female bartender we could not sit there.  In an attempt to order drinks by the waitress station, we were told we could not order at the location.  We finally ordered our drinks and sat down to enjoy them.        We were seated in a loud area with a hot oven behind us.  The plating made me wonder if I was in my school cafeteria again.  The meat was plated and then the mashed potatoes and spinach were slopped on the plates.          The Coode raw was exiting the restaurant to see a parking attendant yell at an Irish nation accusing him of being drunk because the parking attendant could not understand his accent.      I have sent several emails and a fax to The House of Prime Rib.  Even calling them an overpriced Harry's Hoff braw but I never received a response from them.</review>

	<review>Terrible poor quality food. The prime rib is fatty and cheap big cuts of factory cow meat. To top it off their manager is a special class of douchebag. Their valet guy tried to run me over with another guest's suv, and then the employee verbally threatened me for WALKING ON THE SIDEWALK. I went in to the restaurant to tell them about this. The manager refused to apologize and acted as if I did something wrong. He blamed it on the valet subcontracting company, saying they were at fault an he had nothing to apologize for. I'm guessing this is the same excuse they also use when their valet guys damage diners' cars. This is an awful tourist trap. Save yourself and get better value for money and go to Harris' instead. Amazingly poor customer service.</review>

	<review>This is a Cautionary tale- First, please remember this is a super fancy place that requires you were a dress shirt and dress pants, although some people wore jeans and a short sleeve. We ordered a Bloody Marry (vodka tomato juice) from the bar.  I watched in horror and outrage  as the bartender poured Gordon Vodka ($10 for 1.5 L Bottle) and the super cheeepe bloodyMarry Mix in a plastic bottle sold at safeway for $2.50. I shit you not.  We drink a lot, Gordon is by far one of the absolute cheepest and completely un-drinkable vodkas ever.  That mix is reserved for a mcdonalds drink. I actually suspected eventually that the bartender was trying to f***ck us over, because i was just unable to believe the whole thing. Oh and the Bloody Marry WAS $10.00!!!!!!!  ENOUGH SAID.  If I can't walk in to a fancy restaurant/Bar and get a quality good tasting drink for $10, why should I drink something I would never be able to stomache drinking no matter how cheep I was if I made a homemade drink. Food- Prime Rib is very good, the creamed spinache is goood but tastes like Popeyes creamed spinache, tastes caned.   THe side dishes, were a C, potato was to dry to eat.  The career waiter, tryed to make conversation but checked on us NEVER. SO the meat would be 4 stars, everything else between 0-2 stars.  BE WARNED DO NOT BE FOOLED BY ALL THE FANCY ALCOHOL ON THE WALLS AND ON THE BAR YOU WILL BE SERVED THE CHEEPEST ALCOHOL THAT CAN BE BOUGHT.</review>

	<review>Amidst all the glowing reviews, why just 1 star? Take two pounds of expectations, add a gallon of expense, three cups of terrible food and a dash of being seated by the bathroom, and the result is a restaurant as disastrous as a fallen souffle. Tuesday night at around 6 p.m. Parked a block away in the pouring rain as I refuse to dish out another $8 plus tip for valet parking. We don't mind the walk. After all, this IS San Francisco. We wait about 15 minutes for a table, and only after we're seated do I notice the steady stream (pardon the pun) of people rushing by us for the bathrooms. I HATE sitting by the bathroom. It is SO unappetizing to see a guy go in there with a thick book. Gee, how many pages did it take? Or the repeat offenders: usually old guys with enlarged prostates. Note to restaurants: DON'T seat patrons by the bathrooms!!!! Our heavy-handed waitress removed the water glass I gave her that was so filthy I could even detect it under dimmed lighting, and returned with a round loaf of bread with a knife stuck in it like the sword in the stone that was so difficult to carve up, I thought I'd lose a finger (note to insurance company). You'll love the music, especially if you're into Linda Ronstadt, Kenny Rogers or Bread (the band). Don't know who Bread is? You're lucky. I ordered thin sliced prime rib, hubby: thick. My husband also had the salad, so smothered in sweet beets, it was inedible. The creamed corn was God awful. I don't know what kind of salt they used, but it was way over seasoned with a flavor that was completely alien to me. Hubby's creamed spinach was okay. I had a baked potato that my charming waitress heaped mounds of butter, sour cream and a garden's worth of chives on. I scraped most of it off, while my husband had to ask for more gravy for his mashed potatoes. This place is like something out of the 70s with the table-side salad mixing rituals and rolling-out-of-the-prime-rib in a blimp on wheels by a poor Hispanic guy. If I had his job I would be on heroin. Why are Yelpers so in love with this anachronism that is filled with fat fossils engorging themselves on mediocre midwestern fare? Their  "Yorkshire pudding" would be grounds for murder in England, flat and awful, and the waitress plopped it in my aus jus, blissfully telling me for the purpose of sopping it up. And even the horseradish sauces were awful. One was in mayonnaise, one was plain and too hot, and the third was in cream which instantly melted in my dish, which, I might add, my waitress did not warn me was so hot it burned my hand. As an ex-waitress, I nevertheless tipped her 20% as I never blame the server for the food, and some $111.00 lighter, left with the satisfaction that I could at least write this review. Harry's Hofbrau would have been better.</review>

	<review>NOT IMPRESSED Short version:   I asked for one thing, got something else, when I asked for the mistake to be fixed, I was told that I was wrong.  Service sucked, the prime rib sucked, the AUS JUS WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. Maybe I'm an isolated incident? Maybe other parts of the country have higher standards in prime rib? Look at my stats... I don't give out too many 1 star ratings. Long version: To make a long story short... I asked if there was still medium rare available, I was told there was but when my prime rib came it was obviously medium to medium well.  I tried not to say anything, because I normally don't like to complain... but I decided just to see if I could get another piece.  I told the waiter that I really wanted medium rare.  He then tried to argue with me that it was the aus jus that made the meat darker.  I then explained to him that 1) I would rather have the aus jus on the side anyway and 2) aus jus or not, this was not medium rare.  After I sat through a couple evil stares he brought me another prime rib... with aus jus all over it... again.  And again this was not medium rare.  He didn't stick around to see if the second was better.  I ate a couple bites, but by now I had lost my appetite.  The waiter came around again and saw we were not eating and he asked if I was ready for dessert.  I told him that I was ready for the check.  He asked if the second prime rib was better, and I told him no, but not to worry about it.  I was very polite, I used to work in the food industry and I respect waiters.  He then decided that he wanted to argue with me over why I was wrong in not liking the prime rib.  He told me that I must not have ever tried prime rib before.  I just agreed with him and smiled.  What he didn't know is that I bartended at a privately owned steak house back in the mid west and I know my prime rib.  Aside from his horrible attitude... the prime rib was over cooked and the aus jus was over salted and yet still bland and burnt tasting.  I see all of the positive reviews here on Yelp and it makes me want to give this place a second try... I really want it to work out because I love prime rib.  Maybe I'll go again sometime.</review>

	<review>We lived in San Francisco for many years until 2005, and the House of Prime Rib was once our favorite special occasions place. On a rare visit to the City, we had looked forward for months to our return to HOPR.  We made the reservation early, and a friend dropped out last minute, so I had to tell the greeter we were down to two.  He let me know that tables for two were difficult.  We are both marginally physically disabled, so standing and waiting (no benches or chair provided) and being pushed aside for someone to sign a charge slip by the host (not on the counter, mind you, but in the waiting area), were forebodings of a bad experience. When we were seated, we were seated at a small, two-place table that was (I'm absolutely honest) no more than 18 inches from the edge of a round table with five people sitting with our table forcing an opening on theirs.  To make matters much worse, we were on an aisle-way where literally HUNDREDS of people passed during our meal.   The food was not the usual quality we had expected over the years.  We are now VIP members of Lawry's and find their beef far, FAR superior to that of HOPR.  The only thing that was great was the spinning salad.  If I can somehow replicate their dressing recipe, then there's never a need to miss this place again. To be fair, the manager stopped by and we mentioned our dismay.  His quote was "if you don't enjoy yourself, you shouldn't have to pay."  So he knocked our two soft drinks of the cost (which honestly was a little insulting).  I'd rather pay it all than save $5 on tiny sodas (that were not once offered to be refilled, by the way). This left a horrible taste in our mouths, in more ways than one.  SHame on you HOPR and I hope your business suffers if you don't improve!!</review>

	<review>I don't make reservations and I don't have a problem waiting (PERIOD). With that in mind the host took down my party of two, said "You're third on the wait list, make yourself at home." An hour later I ask him how's it going he replies nonchalantly we are next up so it won't be long. An hour later I asked him how's it going and he said they were setting up our table. I then enquired if it normally takes this long. He said "It's hard to guess how long the stand by list takes because people have to cancel or no show." There's a big difference between a wait list and a standby list and I told him that. Plus I told him that it's his freaking job to "host" people and if there's any chance that someone might have to wait one hour, let alone two, he should freaking let them know. He offered to buy me a drink and I asked him if he could give me the last two hours of my life back because I sure as hell wouldn't have waited two hours to eat at freaking House of Prime Rib if he had done his job correctly. I then sat down and ate my really bland, unseasoned, heavy meal and vowed never again to eat some muck like this just because I'm trying to find something my dad might want to eat when he comes to town. Don't eat here... and especially don't get on the "wait list."</review>

	<review>STOP FUCKING UP MY RESERVATION!!!!!!!!! I made a reservation over the phone with a woman for 9pm. I got there promptly at 9pm (my family is a bunch of laggers), valeted the car, checked in, and the manager told me my reservation is actually for 9:45pm. OH HELL NO THANK YOU FOR RUINING MY FATHER'S BIRTHDAY. HE DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO FUCKING EAT HERE ANYMORE AND HE WAS STARVING!</review>

	<review>First of all the food here is good and the staff are  ok  but we were very disappointed that we still had to wait 40 mins to an hour to get seated. I don't care if we had to wait like 10 to 20 mins but almost a whole hour wtf is the point of making a reservation anyways and the other thing that kinda pissed me off is that they kept on seating people that came way later then us, so we went and asked to see if there was going to be a table soon if not then we will just go to Ruth's Chris so all of a suddenly A table was available. The old man came and apologized and promise us free drinks but we did not see any drinks that came to our table. It's whatever. Overall the Food was  good but I think its overrated, the the waitress was very nice and we ended up spending a very, very ,pretty penny there. I expect for places like this to be more professional but hey what can you do. I personally think the people  here are snobbish. (except the waiters and waitresses)</review>

	<review>what is reservation means?  this restaurant top them all poor customer service, even you have reservation you have to wait 1 hour even your party is complete.   and after waiting for 11/2 for my food to arrive, my food is cold feels like fresh from the slaughterhouse fresh, then the manager offer us free desert for what? after waiting for a seat, waiting for my food then food serve cold.  this place is a total dispointment i will think twice before eating on his place. if there is a rating for - star they deserve more negative.</review>

	<review>I am not sure if I have ever been as annoyed as I was trying to have dinner here last Thursday night. Eek...me thinks not. I showed up around 8pm and approached the host for a table. He was currently crouched down behind the host stand eating his dinner upon my approach. He asked if I have a reservation. I did not for 8pm on a Thursday night for a party of two. Yes - we are both here. Ok, we will go have a drink at the bar. Meanwhile we get some good drinks at the bar. The bartender was nice and almost attentive. One hour later and two full bar full of people seated before us and I check with the Host. I am told that we are "next on the NO RESERVATIONS LIST." Apparently this is the new word for screw you list and we were not informed. I am now famished and it is 9:30pm - the bar is empty and the host will not even look our way. We decide to leave. The host catches my eye as I walk out the door. He then has the nerve to send out some poor girl to let us know that our table is "ALMOST READY'. I turned to the poor girl and with as calm a voice as possible let her know that at this point they could kiss my ass. I know it was not the most adult thing to say but really, it was the worst customer service I have received in this city thus far and I eat out a lot. Instead we ended up at Scala - got seated right away. We had a wonderful meal and I will never step foot in HOPR again. Thanks for the experience - now I know.</review>

	<review>Great prime rib, bad post-dinner service. I celebrated my birthday here on June 8 with eight of my friends. The next day, 6 of us had food poisoning symptoms. I called the restaurant on June 11 after I realized so many people had symptoms. The symptoms are the following: Jen - Fever of 102.7, headache, dizziness, nausea Dave - Vomited eight times, shivering, nausea, pain, out for 2 days. Kelly - Diarrhea, stomach pains Jasper - flu-like muscle aches, diarrhea, nausea Justin - mild diarrhea Jason (myself) - mild diarrhea Given this barrage of symptoms, and the fact that the only meal we shared that night was HOPR, you would think the management would have apologized. Not so. The manager denied that anything could have been as a result of the restaurant. No apology, no sympathetic tone. Just denials and accusations.</review>

	<review>overpriced. the food is good. but i can take aged meat and cook it easily like that too. it's not worth the price they charge. notice how their chefs are "cheap labor". because it's so easy to cook overpriced food this style. People like to think that they are cultured by eating here. trust me, paying a lot of money doesn't make you cultured.</review>

	<review>I think this place is a testament to how the west coast can not do a steak house.  I had one of the most painful experiences of my life here and will do anything to get that time back.  Perhaps I'm a steak snob but the HOPR is not a place I would waste my time on. I'll save my appetite for Sparks, Strip House, Old Homestead and Lugers.  If you're from NYC do not go here. It will only disappoint you.</review>

	<review>i am vegetarian but that is not the reason why i give the house of prime rib one star.   ***this could be just a bad experience, but don't let it happen to you*** if you are going with a group, beware of what i call "hidden charges".  they don't actually have it on their web site.  split plate $7.50.  if you bring a birthday cake, they charge $4 per person.   i experienced some billing issues.  the least they could have done was comp my salad or baked potato, which was only a small percentage bill; total bill $459.89 (9 people = 8 meat eater + me, vegetarian). i think that if one specializes in prime rib there should be more options.  why have a menu that opens if you can fit the menu on less than a page?  the wine list probably had 10x the options on the menu.  i think they should rename to the house of prime wine.     ...water is water, no matter what size cup you put it in.  similarly, the prime rib options as follows: small(city), medium(house/english) and large(king). i can not believe the yelper reviews on the salad.  the salad I had was soggy and swimming is dressing.  salad doesn't swim... i think that is called soup. the only positives were the mixed drinks and the motif/atmosphere of the restaurant.  when you order a mixed drink, they give you the shaker which will probably keep you occupied during your wait; next to the fire place and the silent roar of the latest game playing on the screen in the corner.     if you are still reading, and you want to have your own firsthand experience at the house of prime rib. i would advise to make reservations.  (if you are not the reservation type.  make reservations(!), or you will be wondering for a while why you are waiting so long.) ***for reviews on meat...keep scrolling.  (...but i think that if they ask you if you want cracked pepper on your salad, they should ask you if you want it on your prime rib.)***</review>

	<review>If I could give it negative stars I would.  My husband and I had our wedding rehearsal dinner here and it was awful.  Very racist, rude and we still had to tip because we had more than six people in our party.  I admit we are born and raised Bay Area/San Francisco Chinese Americans with the multicultural friends.  Many friends came from all parts of the Bay Area to attend our wedding rehearsal dinner.  So our experience began with snooty hostesses but we were seated promptly.  So okay maybe not so bad but the minute we sat down the racial profiling began.  I mean my white friends were treated with disdain and my asian friends and family were treated like second class citizens.  My brother's baked potato was sitting on a serving cart for 20min. before he finally asked if they were going to serve it to him.  They then condescendingly brought it over without the fixings on the side like he asked.  When they were passing around the corn bread they ran out half way through the table and never came back to give it to the rest of the table.  As for their claim about giving you the seconds if you finish your food the give you the driest piece possible even though I specifically stated medium rear.  Then I got a lecture from the waiter for asking to take home because too dry and well done.  I got the lecture of you people are so cheap.  Now please if I'm footing the bill for my rehearsal dinner that is over $1500 plus mandatory tip I would at least think your service would be less condescending and less racist.  No joke as we were leaving heard one of the wait staff say that they chinese are really cheap that they don't even want to leave more of a tip.   Man that is just wrong considering your service.  I'm a fair person my family ran restaurants I usually don't cheat service people but this was just ridiculous.  I must say if it wasn't for the fact that friends and family were there I would have probably told them off and demanded an apology.   Avoid this place unless you like to be profiled and ridiculed for being asian.</review>

	<review>This was one of my WORST experiences. I know it's my first review, but I wanted to make sure I wrote about it. I went for dinner last Thursday with a moderately sized group (9) and the service was more than awful for such a restaurant. We had reservations for 9:30 PM. And we didn't get seated until 10:40. You know, 40 minutes AFTER the restaurant closes. I know this is common, but I expected at least some service, especially from the manager and maitre d'. Here's how it went: "We're all here." Maitre d': "Ok, we'll let you know when your table's ready." 20 minutes later... "What's the status on the table?" Md: "We're cleaning the table and it should be ready soon." 15 minutes later... "We've been waiting a while for our table. Is it ready yet?" Md: "We've already brought the check out and are waiting for the previous party to finish, so we can clean up the table." Wait a minute... you told us 15 minutes ago that you were cleaning the table. Whatever. Another 20 minutes pass by... Md: "Your table is the round table, the third from the front. Two people are cleaning it now." Obviously, nothing was being done at this time, and the previous party still hadn't left. So I try to be polite and ask again 10 minutes later... "I'm sorry, which table is ours again? I forgot. Oh, the third one from the front? Ah yes, thanks, I see it's being cleaned." No, nobody was cleaning it then. All of us are hungry at this time, and we've waited over an hour. Finally, another waiter/maitre d'/host brings us to our table, one that clearly is too small for a party of 9. We tell this to our host, who doesn't seem to care. Then we ask for the manager, and he rolls  his eyes. The manager (owner?) comes out and we list our complaints about the table and the terrible service. He offers to move us, if we want to wait for an additional amount of time. Are you kidding me? It's 10:40pm and we're f'ing hungry. He proclaims, almost nonchalantly, "I'll tell you what. Dessert is on the house!" As if he had done this a million times. Holy f'ing shit. I want an apology, not some free dessert. I tell him, "Your employees were very rude to us. And tell them that it's disrepectful to roll your eyes." He says, "If anyone mistreated you, I want to know their names." I refuse. "Everyone was rude to us. I'm not going to name names." But he insists, and I say no again. You really want to know who was rude to us? 1. The maitre d', who couldn't even be honest about the time. So it's okay to lie to a group of (mostly Asian) twenty-somethings so you can serve your middle-aged white male crowd? Do you feel guilty when you tell patrons that the table is being cleaned up by two people, when clearly the employees are just standing around? And seriously, that table does not fit 9 people. 2. The two female hosts/waitresses who liked to giggle at the front desk: What's your job again? Clearly, you can make yourself useful by, I don't know.. talking to the patrons? 3. The host who seated us at the table. Hey, we waited a long time and we're hungry. At least be polite to us. And don't fucking roll your eyes. 4. The manager. I was looking for an apology, or at least your sympathy. Yes, I know it's a busy night. Yes, I know you're rich and can give us free dessert. I don't care. Here's some advice: I want an acknowledgement that conditions will improve. That you will actually talk to all of your employees. Explain why you're at fault, and that you will make an attempt to rectify it. In fact, I'll give you a template: "I'm really sorry that you had to wait for a very long time, and I understand that you're hungry. We've been really busy tonight, but I promise that you will enjoy this dinner. I've already ordered some appetizers (yes, I know) on the house, and the waiter will bring it out shortly. Dessert will also be free for everyone. We value your feedback, so please let me know if you think we can improve our service in any way." I don't give a damn if you ignore me after that. At least you spent some time to talk to me and even gave it some thought. Is it really that hard? Hell, the first thing our waiter did was to apologize to us. As the manager, you could do the same. The rest of dinner was uneventful. Our waiter was polite and helpful, and the prime rib was, admittedly, delicious. Side dishes were mediocre. Dessert was okay. For all the grandeur and pomp from the manager, I thought they would be better. It seemed like they just threw on sugar or whip cream to make it as sweet as possible. The creme brulee was pretty good, but I found the strawberry shortcake to be too wet, and the other desserts were nothing spectacular. I strongly advise everyone against going there. It's been a week and I'm still angry at the service (as one can tell by this long rant), which was so bad it made the food appear way overpriced. If you really want prime rib, I suggest that you just eat elsewhere. It will save you a lot of trouble.</review>

	<review>The worst service EVER!!! We made reservations and stood in there waiting while others waltzed on in. The host was a total condescending snob who acted like he was on top of the world seating people at the House of Prime Rib. And in the end, it's just prime rib. It really doesn't make any sense to have to put up with horrible service for a piece of meat. This place makes me sick. I know people are going to keep coming here, but if I could get at least one person to stay away, then I've done my job.</review>

	<review>this place is horrible dispite all the hype about it.  i have been to this place several times &amp; leave disapointed every time.  i honestly don't know why everyone pumps this place up so much.  i have had much better for much less.  well you might think that i do not know what i am talking about but i am the son of a butcher &amp; have worked with my dad for over a decade so i know what is a good cut of meat , what it should look like &amp; how it should be prepared.  this place is not it.   i made reservations for my wife &amp; i for 7:30 pm &amp; after leaving w/ my car w/ the valet, we get into the restuarant &amp; check in,  we waited for almost 1 hour.  that totally is not acceptable.  we almost left but finally our table was ready.  i ordered the king henry &amp; my wife ordered the english cut.  my slice was generously cut but it was cooked sub par, i asked for a really rare cut &amp; i got a close to rare, more like medium rare.  as big as this place is who specializes in prime rib &amp; as much prime rib funnels through here i can not believe there are no rare cuts of meat.  my wife's order was ok, she only ate about 1/2 of her meal as it was uber fatty &amp; grisselly.  the sides are ok, bland in most standards.  our waiter was ok, we were often neglected most of the time.   after this exerience here, we vowed never to go back.  definately, not worth the price you are paying for &amp; there is definately much better to be had in this city.  i have had much better prime rib for less &amp; cooked to my liking at hungry hunter &amp; lyons, which is sad.   they do not have a good turn around in keeping their reservations.  street parking is always an issue here &amp; the valet service is a must.  there is a parking garage a couple blocks away if you are up for a walk. like flava flave said back in the eighty's "don't believe the hype".</review>

	<review>Can we give zero stars?  I seriously don't understand the hype this place has received. First of all, if you like prime rib, try Lawry's (I like the one in Beverly Hills).  You get friendlier and more professional service, the restaurant itself is much roomier, and everything from the menu to the giant silver carts is the same.  Oh, except Lawry's has creamed corn, which I regularly dream about to this day. My first outing to the House of Prime Rib was lackluster:  our waiter was rude, unattentive, and dismissive, my silverware came with a preview of the prime rib (disgusting), the sides were noticeably lacking, and the wait time was terrible.  I attributed a lot of my initial experience to a bias due to many favorable experiences at Lawry's.  The prime rib was good, yeah, but everything else left much to be desired.  Especially since its similarities with Lawry's made for a pretty fair comparison. My second visit to the HOPR will be my last.  Our waiter, I'm convinced, was drunk.  He came in red-faced, slightly slurring his words, kept bumping our table as he leaned over (nearly knocking our drinks over), dropped the pudding onto my fellow diner's lap, and then ignored us for half of the night.  When he was preparing our salad it looked like he was about to fall over from the dizziness.  To add insult to injury, he looked shocked and disgusted that we asked for seconds like we were beggars, and came back with a weak slice of meat with nothing else on the plate.  If that wasn't offensive enough, he brought it out as the next table's waiter asked them, cheerily, if they would like seconds; he then brought out generous, fantastic-looking cuts WITH SIDES, while I was left to stare at my pathetic afterthought of a prime rib, sitting alone on its vast, much-too-large plate. I cringe every time someone recommends HOPR for "good steak."  The service was appalling, considering what you get at similarly priced restaurants who happen to serve much better servings of meat.  For the money, I'd rather dine at Ruth's Chris or Boboquivari's in the city. For all your HOPR fans, and I know there are many, I highly suggest Lawry's.  Same menu (but better), and once you try the creamed corn you'll be hooked for life. ### I almost forgot, as we were leaving, our waiter accosted us outside the restaurant and accused us of stealing his pens.  Not politely inquired about his pens, but accosted.  Goodbye, House of Prime Rib.</review>

	<review>The worst experience ever! I do not think I will ever be back... So here is the deal: yes we were late and I understand that you can't seat us and I understand that we have to wait. That it is totally fine (our fault right?).  but man - learn how to manage the expectations... So you can't tell me it will be a couple of minutes and than 20 minutes and than after 1:10 h tell me you have no idea when it will happen... Just explain it to me from the beginning and do not give me that crap that you are "managing the busiest restaurant in the city" Really - just tell me that you have no clue when you will have a table and we have to wait for another party to be late...I would not be mad at that - I would agree with you it is our fault and I would make my decision to wait or to leave. I would just make that decision and hour and 10 min earlier!!! You know what, in  this city there are so many choices I'm sure I can find nicer places for sure. And BTW, your decor is soooooo lame!</review>

	<review>I wish I could give it a zero (0) or -1 star. I have never been so infuriated by any dining experience as this one. I will say it... House of Prime Rib DISCRIMINATES against minorities. They definitely win hands down for my worst restaurant experience anywhere. One time (which was also the last time), we had made the mistake of not making a reservation. We asked the hostess every 30-45 minutes how much longer it would take. She repeatedly answered "you are the next available/open non-reservation table" instead of telling us it would be x amount of minutes. After 3.5 hours of doing this and watching other people without reservations (who were also not minorities) get seated, we finally asked to talk to the manager. The assistant manager/manager-of-the-night came over to the bar-lounge area. He was so rude!!! I would think that in this kind of situation, the manager would apologize for the wait and say something to make the customers happy. He totally did the opposite. He said something that really pissed us off, so we ended up having a shouting match with him in front of everyone! I guess this guy couldn't handle it, so he ended up walking away. We finished our drinks, left, and calmly walked one block to Harris and were seated within 30 seconds. To conclude: GO TO HARRIS'! especially if you are a minority. Harris' is so much better. They have more selection (more than just prime rib), better decor, and great customer service. You also don't have to hear  "happy birthday" singing a hundred times there either. BTW- HOPR totally copied off of LAWRY's in LA.</review>

	<review>Prime rib is Prime rib and shouldn't be that hard to get right, so it's a plus that they get the food that they are named for correct.  Nothing else about this place is good or worth it. Everyone raves about that salad at this place.... Limp lettuce and over-dressed.  Sides weren't tasty.  They had a large wine menu, if I remember, and the server wasn't terrible. I've had much better, for a better price.  Hell, my local pub has a Prime Rib night once a month, and for the price and what I get, I'd eat there every time.</review>

	<review>I love prime rib... yum!  I was in luck because we decided to go here last minute.  I called at 2pm to see if there were any reservations for 7 and there was one last reservation for 7:30... we got there early and chilled at the bar and we didn't get seated til close to 9!!  The bartender we had was really nice and we killed a bottle of Patron Platinum while waiting!  I also filled up on the oriental trail mix that they had in these cute little mini vase like jars at the bar.  We got seated and served immediately after waiting.  The food was flowing in and we didn't have to wait long in between each course.  Everything was tasty or it could've been because we were drunk, lol.</review>

	<review>I had a chance to finally visit this spot a couple of months ago after a large number of people told me I had to go.  I have to say it was nice.  The decor is a little...hmmm, old school, but it has a certain charm.  As a LA man, I had no choice but to compare it to Lawry's, and to be honest, its not Lawry's in terms of ambiance, but it has its own vibe that was cool.   The meat was well cooked, although my medium rare was not as rare as I like...haha...everything tasted good, although I still had a longing for my Lawry's Prime Rib.  haha...The food was plentiful, including the side dishes.  And the best part,  you get a sliver more of meet if you are done with yours that makes it quite worth the extra wait. I would definitely recommend people to check this place out if they're ever in town.  If you're a fan of Lawry's in LA, then you'll enjoy the HOPR...</review>

	<review>the best prime rib you'll find on the planet. they prepare it their own way which involves letting it rot or something like that and thats what makes it so good. the ambiance is nice and makes you feel like you're in some kind of english steak house in the 19th century. sure its busy and the waiters are always in a rush but thats becaue its the best prime rib on the planet. therefore i excuse the haughtiness that comes with this particular experience. the best prime rib on the planet.</review>

	<review>I love prime rib and this is one of the best. I would recommend ordering the King Henry cut (bone in) and having it medium rare. It was so juicy, just melts in your mouth! With the prime rib, it also includes salad (pretty good, the dressing is interesting), potato (either mash or baked, I usually don't eat it), cream spinach (loved it), and pudding (tasted bland but interesting). If you are still hungry after one round of prime rib, you can ask for seconds it's free (pretty small slice though, I mean small). I would recommend calling in for reservation or doing it through open table. If you just do a walk in, the wait can be very very long.. I would also recommend Broadway Prime.</review>

	<review>This is my all time favorite restaurant.  I've been celebrating my birthdays here ever since I was a little girl.  The prime rib is exceptionally tender and juicy, and hand carved table side.  It's accompanied with a side of creamed spinach (or creamed corn), baked potato (or mashed) and yorkshire pudding.  The salad is absolutely amazing as well.  This place isn't cheap but everything is REALLY GOOD and worth every penny.  You're looking to spend about $50/person without drinks. Parking sucks around the area but there's valet service for $8.  Don't waste gas driving around and take advantage...</review>

	<review>I have been wanting to go to this restaurant for years and I finally had the chance to this past weekend.  This is a terrific restaurant and truly a San Francisco institution. FOOD The prime rib itself was very moist and juicy.  I ordered the house cut which still had the bone attached.  Yum!!!  I might try the English cut next time as other guests in my party had that and they said it was good.  I like how the cooks come around with the huge metal carts to slice your meat right in front of you and to keep the meat juicy and fresh.  As for the sides, the beet salad was awesome.  I really like how they prepare and mix it in front of you.  The sides of mash potatoes, creamed spinach, and yorkshire pudding were also noteworth and complimented the meal.  The only thing that was OK was the corn bread; I wished the corn bread would taste more "corn-like". SERVICE Service was a little slow between the waiter taking our order and the serving of the meal.  But it was a weekend evening so it is expected to take a while.  After we got our salad, service picked up.  The waiter who served us was attentive once we got our food.  Even the manager stopped by during our meal to check on our table, which is something we do not see at restaurants as much. DECOR The decor was classic.  It was very warm inside and very inviting.  They had the fireplace going which was a nice touch.  Our party got a booth which was very comfortable.  I recommend getting one if you can as it will make your experience much more pleasurable. OTHER NOTES This is a great place to take out of towners and will definitely come again.  I recommend making reservations (i.e. Open Table) as it does get busy on the weekends.  Valet parking when I went was $8 which is not bad given that the parking in that area of Van Ness is hard to find on a weekend evening.</review>

	<review>Came back on a triple date last Saturday and was happy since I miss their Yorkshire pudding and creamed spinach. With a 8 reservation, we still had to wait about 15 minutes! Got seated in the inner dinning room that looks like a library? Our waiter, David, was very nice and funny. Menu looked the same besides the prices. Man, they go up every time I go back. First it was $29, $30, $32, $34, and now $36.95 for the House of Prim Rib cut! With gas so expensive recently, I wish I could split it with the BF but we're both big eaters so no can do! I ordered the English Cut this time ($36.95) which is three thin slices of the prime rib. I should of ordered the House of Prime Rib cut instead because the thin slices are so thin that it just tasted like a thick slice of roast beef. The BF's thicker cut tasted a little better but didn't taste as good as the first time I've had it. The creamed spinach was OK and wasn't as good as before too. Now they offer creamed corn too so I chose that as a side instead of spinach. I guess you can say it's good but really fatty! Dessert, we ordered the strawberry shortcake. The biscuit was a little over baked but the strawberries were sweet but probably because they marinated it in loads of sugar! I'd probably come back but not until a while later.</review>

	<review>The House of Prime Rib is one of my favorite places to eat in San Francisco and actually quite affordable. When you think about it, your getting a nice sized slice of steak with the option of a second free 6 oz. slice plus the Yorkshire pudding, creamed spinach and mashed potatoes for about $36-$40, that is pretty damned good for a delicious steak dinner that fills you up past the brim. Parking can be a pain but usually isnt too bad. The ambiance inside is great as is the service.  If your looking for an affordable, delicious steak dinner, this is the place to go.</review>

	<review>I had the King Cut, and the wife had a smaller cut.  The menu is very simple.  They have prime rib, and some fish of the day.  I don't really know why someone would order the fish, but it is there.  That sums up the menu.  No steak, no pork, no chicken, no tofu.  Just like the name says Prime Rib.  It is glorious!  They start you out with a great salad (the house dressing is awesome) and fresh bread, try not to fill up here.  Then comes the real deal old fashion meat and taters.  My King cut had to be over a pound of meaty goodness, accompanied by a large baked potato stuffed with bacon, butter, sour cream and chives, YUM.  I went for the creamed spinach over the corn and feel I made the right choice. About 3/4 of the way through I felt like giving up but decided because it was the day before thanksgiving I should gorge to stretch out for the big day.  I powered through this great meal and decided to be a true glutton and ordered the tiramasu.  I am glad I did!!!  It was a large portion and made just right.   I had to take away 1 star for the tiny booth Me (husky) and two friends (also husky) and my wife (not husky) had to cram into.  If I am going to eat this kind of meal I need room to work.   Thanks for a great night.</review>

	<review>Used to LOVE this place. LIke LOVE. In LA, I used to love it so much that for a period I would go to Lawry's House of Prime Rib with my dad about four times a month. I thought this place was the bomb diggity back in college, but the last time I went here, not so yummy at all. Prime rib was dry and tough, as was my significant other's..Wth! Maybe it was a bad day...they were nice though, we complained and they brought me a new piece that was still dry and tough. *Sigh* I love the spinning salad sooo much, but won't be back here anytime soon. Boo.</review>

	<review>I have waited this long to review HoPR because I didn't think I'd be able to write about this place without drooling all over my keyboard. What I love most about HoPR is the campy feel. The meat is oversized and carved tableside. The knives are huge and have a giant logo on them. The Yorkshire pudding on your plate is the size of a pizza slice from Za. Okay, okay. Back to what everyone wants to know about- the prime rib. My mom's prime rib is still my favorite, hands down. But HoPR definitely knows how to do it right. And since it's carved tableside, you'll be able to see exactly where your meat is coming from...from a large serving cart and a man with a very silly looking chef's hat.</review>

	<review>a landmark, no doubt. I love the people in there. They're part blue hair, part SF elite, part shitheads like me. It's great. Also, if I was locked in a house made entirely of that fucking AWESOME salad they roll out to you, I'd eat my way out in like 3 minutes. And I hate salad. This salad however has been touched by god or allah or whoever the fuck invented THAT SALAD. They make perfect drinks. The bartenders are throwbacks, and funny as shit. in other words, awesome. They'll rip on you right in front of the broad youre with to make you a. look bad, and b. make your date feel awesome that you took her to such an interesting cool place. The prime rib is excellent. You finish the half a cow they cut for you and they'll give you more on the house. It's like you've died and gone to heaven except heaven is 1953, youre drunk, and there's meat everywhere. Final Grade: A freaking PLUS.</review>

	<review>I want to start by saying the silver prime rib cart they push around in the restaurant is now on the top of my Christmas list. I can't think of a more fulfilling meal than the one you typically get at the HOPR.  The spinning salad is possibly one of the best salads I've ever had and and even got me to like beets.  The prime rib is always incredibly tender, though occasionally I get a slice that has almost as much gristle than meat.   The recent addition of creamed corn is also a great plus, though I think it doesn't match up to the creamed corn served up by Lawry's.  Same goes for the Yorkshire pudding.  But overall, think it's one of my favorite meals in the city.</review>

	<review>Basic and cut to the chase.  This is not an extensive menu.  They'll probably even look at our weird if you order the fish (the one item on the menu that's not prime rib).  But I like that they do one thing and keep focused. The sourdough bread was great, the house salad good but swimming in dressing, the cornbread a surprise (someone with a basket just started walking around plopping them down on our bread plates without a word), the creamed spinach tasted like there was foil in it or something (not good, try the creamed corn), the yorkshire pudding just confusing, and the mashed potato standard fare. BUT the prime rib..that was good.  I've tried to cut down on the red meat for health reasons, but tonight I made the exception.  Go big or go home.  I had it medium rare.  Bloody goodness!  I only had to chew it two or three times...it melted in your mouth.  I'm usually a light eater, but i was able to get through most of the "city cut" (the smallest cut). If you like you're plates clean and dressed, this is not your place.  It's about meat and gravy.  Let your hair down, check your blood pressure and enjoy!</review>

	<review>Food was ok, But service was horrible. Waiter gave me cooked meat for the requested rare meat. He reach across me entirely to serve the person next to me that i had to move. There was hair on my potato. He took away my food before I finished (first plate) and replaced it with half the portions that I had. In addition, as he took away our plates, he looked like he practically embraced my aunt when he reached around her. Too overpriced to deal with this kind of service again. Outback is my first choice.</review>

	<review>I love it here. My parents used to take me and my sister here when we were younger. Now my sister and I take my parents here. The salad is great, romaine lettuce with a bit of watercress thrown in, beets, crumbled egg yolk (I think), tossed tableside and served with freshly ground pepper, if you so wish it. My mother loves the salad. The sourdough bread is wonderful...fresh and hot, it tastes like they baked it right before you sat down. Indulge and spread as much butter as you would like, as the women in my family are wont to do. The prime rib is consistently very good. They serve your order exactly as you ordered it. Want super spicy horseradish? We asked for it, got it, and I teared up when I dabbed a bit on my tongue because I didn't believe they gave us the spicy one. Yorkshire pudding is my absolute favorite thing there, aside from the prime rib and the bread and butter. Went there last night for my dad's bday, and everything was spot on. We had the most excellent waitress; unfortunately, I didn't get her name, so I can't give her proper credit. Always a good go-to restaurant. And the elderly man that walks around asking everyone if everything is okay is so cute! He's been there for as long as I can remember.</review>

	<review>been here twice for dinner: one with hubby and the second time: with hubby and MIL..  luckily both times for free.  ;o) both times the servers were great.  the ambiance is quite romantic, it has the vintage decor menu is simple.  you just need to choose which cut of meat you want. The mix salad with thousand island dressing has eggs, beets, lettuces and other things.  They give you lots of salad that they toss infront of you but I just want to stop that server from putting that much dressing. You get to choose what kind of horseradish you want.. and the server was very helpful to make us aware which one is the spiciest. You also get to choose your sides: yorkshire pudding, creamed spinach, corn and others. the meat, the sides, the drinks were all good. I think there's nothing so special with the place. If you like old school, traditional service and food, try this place.</review>

	<review>After watching this place featured on Anthony Bourdain, it's fair to say my expectations were very high. The Prime Rib, is as expected. If you like Prime Rib, go here! If you like some flavor and flare in your meat, don't go here. What comes before the Prime Rib? Sourdough loaf and butter- can't mess that up. And they don't. It's really good. Our salad was wilted, dressing was tasteless. The creamed corn is the substitute for those who cannot eat pork, therefore cannot have the creamed spinach. It was also mediocre. The crowd was mostly teenage groups having birthday parties. This place isn't horrible. But I really didn't find it to be what I expected after reading the reviews. Maybe I'm just a steak girl? Also our server was so busy juggling tables, that our experience really suffered. If one person didn't have a napkin, someone else didn't have a fork and we were left waiting for long periods of time. I'm glad I went once to see what it's all about. But I probably won't go back again.</review>

	<review>I have nothing but fond memories of House of Prime Rib. It is such an amazing place. Valet parking is available outside, so it's really convenient. The decor is nice and comforting. It's a really neat place to take someone on a date, or if you just want to be somewhere nice. Just don't make the mistake of taking a vegetarian here. The menu is really simple: pick your cut, how you want it cooked, and how you want your potatoes. That's pretty much it. There's a tossed salad and bread prior to the main course. And, oh, what a main course it is. The prime rib is delicious! Expertly cooked, juicy and succulent... a divine experience. The creamed spinach is so good, as is the yorkshire pudding. The only downside is that there is sometimes a bit of a wait, even if you have reservations. Otherwise, it'd be a five star place, easy.</review>

	<review>Let me start with the only thing I would change, the only thing that kept this from being a 5-star review.  On my last visit, we were given a table that was in the middle of a main route of traffic and between a few other tables.  I'm not usually super picky about the table I get, but it felt like the "hey, we could maybe squeeze in a 2-top here" table. Now on to the good stuff.  Do you like beef?  Could you roll around in beef juice for hours?  Do you wish there was beef perfume?  Then this place is for you!!!  Big slabs of tender, juicy, delicious beef that fill your plate and your belly.  Meals start with a delicious salad and some awesome, warm bread.  Then on to the main event with beef, yorkshire pudding and (for me at least) baked potato and creamed corn.  If you can find any fault in those four things, you and I may not be able to be friends.  This time, my date and I also treated ourselves to the strawberry shortcake.  We were not disappointed.  Beautiful, fresh strawberries, decadent whipped cream, moist cake . . . I was in heaven. Could I go here every day?  Heck no!  Probably not even once every month.  However, as a special occasion splurge, this restaurant fits the bill.  I'll definitely be back.</review>

	<review>Unbelievable - after reading the previous reviews I am a little baffled. How come everyone else gave this place great reviews and only a few of us have met or spoken to the manager and had problems. The manager I spoke to was the most unbelievable unprofessional, unkind man I have yet to encounter in the hospitality industry. I was trying to reserve a table for 26 people (Japanese tourists); the reservationist confirmed the reservation and took my credit card for guarantee. He then transferred me to the manager to speak about menu options. The manager flat out did not want to accommodate a set menu and in the process was completely rude and curt. He then had the audacity to call me later to cancel our reservation - saying that his restaurant was full - he is such a LIAR.... Obviously this restaurant has done well for itself and has made a name for itself - but how - under such rude management - I will never understand. Oh by the way - did I mention that his staff feel the same way I feel about him....</review>

	<review>APRIL 27th is NATIONAL PRIME RIB DAY. It's been a really long time since I've been there, something like three years, but I am having a huge craving because I have always been really happy with this place.  The Prime Rib arrives at your table and you get to choose your meat.  It's juicy and melts in your mouth.  And when you finish one cut - they have to give you another piece!  Yes, and I thought, "Ha, I'll fool them and take home a whole piece for dinner tomorrow!"  wrong.  I ate the entire second piece, too.  And the Caesar Salad and Creamed Spinach are so good, it's hard to choose which bite to take.  And the bar makes strong drinks, the staff are funny and friendly.  And best of all - they'll take a photo of you for the good memories.   I can't wait to go back.  It's kind of expensive, so I gotta figure out a really good reason to go.  Holy shit!  I just looked up National Prime Rib Day and it's APRIL 27th.  SCORE!</review>

	<review>3.5 Stars overall Came here for a celebration, but I wasn't impressed overall.  The service was great, but the food was mediocre and the table was way too small for their large portion plates. I felt super cramped and the plates were on top of each other. I ordered the King Cut with the sides (Corn and mashed potatoes). The sides were horrible, and the salad was drenched in too much dressing. Maybe I should've asked her to leave the dressing on the side. However, the prime rib was delicious and the house bread was fresh out of the oven! If you finish your King Cut, you can ask for second. We ordered the English Triffle dessert and it was eh. The taste of alcohol (if there were any) was overpowering! If you have a smaller appetite, you can do a split plate with your dining partner for a charge of around $8.</review>

	<review>Racist staff? Or just equal opportunity providers of awful service? OK - for those who only care about the food itself, I'd say the quality and cooking of the meat was good-not-great, the sides were tasty, and the portions big for the price. I'd give it a 3.5 for food. However, I was very surprised by the extremely bad attitude of one host and hostess. After reading other reviews, I have to wonder whether racism is alive and kicking at this "SF establishment," or, giving them the benefit of the doubt, whether we were merely victims of garden-variety rudeness. I did note that we were seated in a room in the back that was full of other minority diners. We had reservations, but had to wait for our entire party to arrive before we could be seated. It's a policy that many restaurants use; however, I am not convinced it was totally necessary for the host to tell us about the rule with such an arrogant expression. After everyone arrived, one person went to the restroom while another informed snobby guy that we were all here. A hostess appeared, menus in hand, and she counted us, then turned on me with a sarcastic sort of shrug of the shoulders. I told her one person was in the restroom and she looked over at the host, who gave her a secret signal by sticking his nose high in the air and *rolling his eyes* and she refused to seat us. Right then our missing person walked back toward the group, but the hostess literally stood there tapping her foot until she REACHED us, then huffed and set off toward the penalty box of a back room. I tried to give everyone the benefit of the doubt ("maybe they get people lying to them a lot?") but honestly it was a pretty awful experience being treated like second-class citizens. The food is definitely not worth the treatment we received, especially since there is plenty of better stuff available. I've heard rave reviews from people I trust on this place, so I can only hope our experience was atypical.</review>

	<review>An old school San Francisco institution! 62 years old and still one of the busiest restaurants in town. This restaurant represents old San Francisco! Classic San Francisco! And I had the pleasure of dining here last night. An hour and a half wait on a Wednesday- I have to admit that I foolishly did not see that coming! So what do you do when you have a long wait at the House of Prime Rib? You drink! Gin martinis to be exact...always dirty and always strong- served from a shaker which stays on your table, and has left overs in it. So its really more like 2 martinis- even better :) The menu is as simple as it gets- 3 different cuts of prime rib, bone in or bone out, baked potato or mashed, creamed corn or creamed spinach! Thats it! You get started off with a large salad; once again, comes with your meal. The salad is large, but only tastes ok. The dressing seems like a mix of Italian and 1000 Island. Next came that juicy, bloody, flavorful cut of prime rib served with, creamed spinach, Yorkshire pudding, and a massive baked potato loaded with sour cream, chives and bacon. All of which was delicious- mind you I am not even the biggest fan of prime rib. The only problem is that there is far too much food. After completing the almost impossible task of finishing all your food, the waiter comes by and asks "would you care for a complementary second serving?" The response of any normal person- "Are you crazy? No thank you" then falls a sleep with ones head on the table.</review>

	<review>I have been here twice. Both times had the exact same problems. The first time I had a reservation for 9:15. I wasn't seated until 10:15. I sat at the bar and listened to the tender with a bad attitude complain constantly. There was a group of underage children stealing drinks from the bar. They were all dressed like Justin Bieber, running all over the place and obnoxious. I was only that age a few years ago and I was embarrassed for them and everyone there. If this was my restaurant, they get through the front door. I eventually was seated, and our waiter was fantastic. Polite, quick, to the point, and didn't want to be our buddy. It was the only part of the night that went well here. The second time I had a reservation for 8. I called at 7 to see if we could be seated at 9 instead. They couldn't find my reservation so they created a new one for 8:30. I arrived at 8:15 to check in for our NEW 8:30 reservation. The 8:30 reservation couldn't be found either. We were told would have to wait because were 15 minutes late for our 8pm original reservation that they said they couldn't find. I sat and waited until an hour until they seated me and my friends. While we were seated there was a fire in the kitchen. The fire department came and I had to leave the restaurant because it was so smoky. Then we were given the worst table in the restaurant, listened to some hood-rats next to us who literally "rapped" out-loud at the table about bitches, blunts and big screen TVs. Second biggest complaint, after the host, are the people here. They are dressed too casually. Yes California is casual and a jacket and tie is pushing it, but people wore dirty white sneakers, t-shirts, cut offs, and sandals. There was even one guy with "jargos" and a nascar tanktop. I was over dressed in loafers, sports jacket, nicer jeans. I wouldn't mind paying more to keep the trash out. The food in general is ok. The salad, bread, and drinks are good. The prime rib is just OK. I used to think it was great until I went to a few other prime rib restaurants like Sundance in Palo Alto, which changed my mind about house of prime rib. Bottom line, I won't be returning because they can never get me seated on time and the people are disgusting. Food is decent. Decor is tacky.</review>

	<review>Every single year my dad asks if we can take him to House of Prime Rib for his birthday. I don't blame him because HoPR has got to be one of the most iconic restaurants in San Francisco that serves up some delicious prime rib. The scene: It's got an old school steak restaurant kind of feel. Lots of wood paneling, oversized booths in the main dining area, and large chandeliers all throughout the restaurant. HoPR has several dining rooms and each get plenty of attention from each of its servers. Each room has a carving station for the carver to slice and present your meat for his guests. The food: Each prime rib meal is about $30-$40. When ordering at HoPR, you pick from their variety of cuts. The English cut is the smallest which features 3 thin slices of prime rib. The city cut is thicker than the English cut, but is the thinest out of the actual cuts. The House of Prime Rib cut is their house cut which is about an inch and a half to two inchest thick. Good size if you're planning to take home leftovers. The largeset size of them all is the King Henry VIII cut. It's about 3-4 inches of goodness with the bone. You're able to get seconds if you finish your meal too!!! Sides - So with your prime rib you get a butt load of sides (unless you order ala cart) - salad with house dressing, mashed potatos or a baked potato, creamed spinach or creamed corn, yorkshire pudding and corn bread in the shape of a corn. The salad is really one of the best salads I've ever had. They dress the mixed greens with beets, chopped egg and a "special" dressing I have yet to find the name of. FYI - you can purchase the dressing with a 2 week expiration date. The creamed spinach is made with bacon, YUM! The least favorite would be the Yorkshire pudding. There are many people out there that don't understand what Yorkshire pudding is. It is a light bread that's made with flour, eggs, milk and butter and is baked in really hot fat or oil. It really doesn't taste like anything, so I usually avoid it since it's so fatty. Peach Melba - This dessert is essentially peaches with raspberry sauce on top of ice cream. It was refreshing after the heavy meal. It didn't wow me, but you can't go wrong with peaches and ice cream. Fantasy Cake - I've never seen a dessert like this before! It features layers of chocolate mouse, chocolate cake and cheese cake with raspberry sauce. So rich, but so good. HoPR is a real treat if you decide to come here. Everyone and their mamas celebrates their birthday at House of Prime Rib. This place is fancy, so make sure you come dressed appropriately.</review>

	<review>Went for our annual New Year's Eve dinner and it did not fail.  This place has always been about tradition and staying true to their winning formula.  The 2nd helping is not a lie, but it is pretty thin slice (not that you can take down another giant piece).  Bread was typical (good, but way too hot to hold and slice), salad was the the typical iceberg/beets/had-boiled eggs, creamed spinach was decadent, baked potato had about 2 slices of bacon crumbled on top, yorkshire pudding was light and airy and the prime rib was tender and flavorful.   Is there better prime rib?  Probably, but HOPR is a total old school experience.  Staff is friendly (we ate early so the crowd was not too bad) and the ambiance just calls out for an amber liquor on the rocks, served in a heavy old fashioned glass.  if you are having a martini or cosmo, they'll bring you the shaker with a second portion of your drink ready for you when you need it.  Go for the entire experience - it is not cheap but a good special occasion place.</review>

	<review>Service = good (not great, not bad) Food quality = great Food taste/flavor = good Drinks = great But honestly... I'll take Lawry's in LA over HOPR any day. House of Prime Rib is great, and I'd even argue that it's THE best place in SF for prime rib, but I also expect more from this place than what I received. The quality of the food is the best you can find, but the flavor of that food is another story. Prime Rib was overdone (when asked for medium rare), and the waiter was slow. Granted it was busy on a sunday night, but slow is slow, especially when you have that many people working there.</review>

	<review>Amazing food, amazing atmosphere, amazing service.  What an ingenious concept- providing four different cuts of prime rib and capitalizing on that.  If you carve it, they will come.   We came here on a Saturday about a half hour before the main crowd was expected in, and the host was able to get our name on the top of the reservation list, so long as we agreed to be out within an hour.  Sure, we like food.  We can do that.   I seem to have developed a salad fetish recently, so I was really hung up on the beautiful salad.  OMG, I'm talking "in love".  My boyfriend begged me not to finish all of it before the main course came out, as it was huge and he knew I wouldn't have room for all of dinner, but I couldn't help myself.  It had to be eaten.   The prime rib here is absolutely amazing- I had the English Cut, as I prefer thinner slices of meat.  Taste was perfect and swimming in just the right amount of tons of juice- seriously delish.  I also had the baked potato, which was a meal in itself, and I didn't get to tackle until I got home because of it's monstrous size. Prices are also decently reasonable.  We will definitely be back.   Oh yes.  They also have pretty decent drinks.  Bottoms up!</review>

	<review>House of Prime Rib. The name is no lie. Right in the heart of San Francisco, Van Ness Avenue. Hey isn't there a Lamborghini store down the street? Well this place is fancy as fancy gets. Only difference is it has relaxations of a late night diner.  No joke... I literally knew this place was going to be fancy and walked in with jeans and a tee with no problem and also may have worn a baseball cap to finish my outfit. This place looks like I just walked into the dining room of a my aun'ts house. I like the homely feel. The selection is pretty straight forward, prime rib on the menu it's the matter how you like to take your cut. I myself am a man. The King Henry VIII Cut, the biggest cut I can get, is what satisfies my hunger. Like any other fancy restaurant it starts with the salad. Can I say there's good salad? Because this place serves the best salad. I really thought the beets were strips of raw meat and I sure love my meat. Fooled me, so well I might as well become a vegan. Who am I kidding... meat is way to good to give up. Sorry PETA. It's a very big plate, not one of those dinky salad plates that your local Pier 1 Imports would sell. This is a freakin' dinner plate of salad. I see their angle fill me up with your salad so I don't get my second cut. Yes, the second cut. If you manage to finish your first cut you can get a helping of a second thin sliced cut. But we're getting way ahead of ourselves. I haven't even gotten my King Henry yet and thinking about a seconds. The King Cut, this hunk of meat is served right on the bone. I like to eat my meat rare as possible. Bloody, juicy, just like how dad use to make it. Did I mention the prime rib has been marinating in juices for 21 days? Yup, that's through and through with a great burst of flavor.  Throw in some horse raddish and we have lift off. One thing I dislike about the King Cut is the amount of fat content in this cow especially off the bone. No matter, still pretty damn awesome. Do I dare to eat this cut of fat? Dare me. Yeah, that's pretty gross, but that's where all the salty taste is. Diabetes will surely kill me one day if I ate this everyday. My body is gonna hate me for the next week while I burn all that fat I just ate. Accompany your meal if you will with Creamed Spinach. You'll definitely enjoy it. Please give me a second cut just because I can. It's not as great the first time around. My palette grows weary after forcing my way through that King Henry. Can't have a great night without dessert, they're special too. Tiramisu is top notch and wash it down with a shot of cognac. If money isn't an issue after spending about $50 on your meal go for the $30 shot of cognac. Don't go home with a rough taste in your mouth. Fancy.</review>

	<review>First, I ordered the fish of the day (they had a choice of mahi mahi or salmon for $32.25): grilled salmon.  Why order fish at the HoPR?  It wasn't my idea to go there and I prefer fish.  Anyway, if I were to rate them just on the side dishes, I'd give them three stars.   The fish of the day comes with the house salad, Yorkshire pudding, mashed potatoes and asparagus.  If you don't choose the fish, your only other choice is some variant of a prime rib dinner (with salad, Yorkshire pudding, mashed or baked potato, creamed spinach or creamed corn) starting at $30 (unless you get the kid's prime rib dinner which I considered, but it's only for kids 8 and under). * Warm round loaves of sourdough bread:  It's nice that the bread is warm but otherwise the bread was average.  The knife that's stuck in the loaf doesn't work well for cutting - it's not a bread knife. * House salad.  They spin and toss the salad (romaine lettuce, beets) tableside.  It was decent, nothing special.  The dressing tasted like a combination of Thousand Island &amp; Italian, sweet and a bit sour.  The salad seemed to have too much dressing. * Yorkshire pudding.  A fluffy golden baked pancake, served hot and fresh from the skillet.  Mild tasting, slightly crispy edges.  I felt like dusting it with powdered sugar rather than eating it with something savory. * Grilled salmon - decent size, in a creamy lemon sauce.  Not horrible but I had better grilled salmon at Muracci's the day before (for $9).  I can cook better salmon.  The asparagus spears were overcooked. * Mashed potatoes - way too smooth and bland.  Making good mashed potatoes is easy.  Get the baked potato instead.   * Spicy horseradish sauce - yummy and creamy * Seasoning salt on the table - has MSG.  Very salty.  Avoid using.   The ambiance is warm and inviting (fireplace, TV, full bar, booths) and the spinning salad, signature knives (they say House of Prime Rib on them) and silver carving stations add to the old school, dimly lit, formal/dressy attire aura.  Since the menu is so limited, they should master every side dish and they don't.  In fact, since they only offer prime rib or fish as an entrée, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect stellar fish.  But I get the feeling that they're in auto-pilot at this point - after years of having the same menu.</review>

	<review>My boyfriend brought me here for Valentine's Day. It was a surprise from him. He lied to me saying we were going somewhere else. But this is a place where you should make reservations beforehand. It's crowded here and the wait is long. I think we still had to wait a bit for our table to be ready. They have a nice lounger area where you can wait and order drinks. We were lucky and got a booth seating. I got the City Cut. I must say, the salad was really good. It's fun watching them make the salad in front of you. Overall, the food was really good. Since it was Valentine's Day and I wanted something to remember it by. I asked the waiter if he had take a picture of us with the polaroid camera that they had. He was more than welcome to do so. Cause I think they only do it for birthdays? I'm not quite sure. Overall, I enjoyed my stay here. I didn't have any problems and our waiter was really nice.</review>

	<review>We had an 8:30 reservation on a Friday night. We arrived and the place was super busy. As a visitor in the city, this was my first time. It's really well decorated and obviously quite popular. The host asked if we were all there but 2 people were looking for parking, which was quite a challenge. Finally they found parking and we informed the host. He said there were now a few tables ahead of us, not happy. We waited and waited, after over an hour past our reservation we were finally seated. Once we were seated we got taken care of quickly and our server was great. The food was great and there was tons of it!! I would give more stars for the food alone but not with the long wait! Arrive very hungry, don't eat too much bread, and be early with all party members so you don't have to wait well past your reservation.</review>

	<review>For someone who's not a big fan of red meat, I sure have been eating a lot of it lately...  I think I've had my fill, enough to sustain me through the end of 2006. Though prime rib is not my first choice when it comes to beef, I was content with my meal.  The baked potato was perfect, creamed corn was decent (would've had creamed spinach, but I just had it the other day), and the generous cut of prime rib was more than I can handle.  I took my leftovers home because I know someone will want to eat the other half of my prime rib... The cremebrulee was off.  They didn't let the sugar harden long enough before they served it. Service was good, especially with the large crowd in the tiny room.  The biggest annoyance from the evening were all the '49ers fans crowded in one table (about 15 of them), and the group next to us who kept cackling...  Kudos to one of the patrons who asked them to tone it down!  The guy did what nobody else had the courage to do... I'd go back again, but I need it to be quiet enough so I can hear the radio.  It'll be a long time until I get the urge to eat red meat again...</review>

	<review>I gotta say a big "eh" here.   Why would you go to HOPR when you can go right down the street to Harris'?   Sure, at Harris' you don't get your hunks o' meat out of a big metal coffin/iron lung looking chingadera but why would you want to anyway?   And if you look closely, those mini meat Air-streams are held together with aluminum foil and a prayer.     The meat is subpar. .totally fatty and just ick.  I had to leave about half my serving on the plate 'cause it was inedible and I am not one of those "ack, it's fat it will make me fat" kind of girls, it was just too much.   But, in the end I gotta admit they pack 'em in . . this restaurant is hopping from open to close . . why, I don't know . .. perhaps they lace their jus sauce with crack.   Two stars for the ancient waiters who are old school enough to call you doll and get away with it and the hyper yummy creamed spinach.</review>

	<review>Wife and I were in town, driving and sightseeing gave us an appetite that SF. dining would surely fix. I had heard many good things about this place. How does one not get the feeling of perfection when they enter this place. It has dark, wooden overtones. The chairs in the waiting area are all comfy, leather. Unique. We ordered drinks after putting our names on the list (really, people book a month in advance?), I ordered a lime margarita on the rocks with whatever top shelf silver tequila they had. A REAL lime margarita uses only fresh squeezed limes, not rose's lime syrup. SO, a thirteen dollar margarita should have fresh squeezed limes, not syrup. We waited about an hour to be seated. I had high standards of this place from the atmosphere. I have had pretty good prime rib from Cattleman's in Livermore and would rate theirs against the house of prime rib. In all honesty, the meat is great, although not wait-an-hour great. The trio of horseradishes is fun. The starter salad was probably my favorite part of the meal, my wife went all giddy for the beets, and the house dressing was spectacular. I wish they would simply name their cut by weight, not British names, although this may simply be part of the place's motif. It may also help fix any mis-orders, too. If you're in town, call ahead and see how long seating will take. It's a great place to go for a special occasion, such as dad's 50th, with the hope that he likes Yorkshire pudding. I can get a prime rib here in town that tastes about 90% of this place, without the hassle of city parking or wait time, which is why I give it 3 stars.</review>

	<review>House of Prime Rib is always consistent and never disappoints.  Their menu is super simple; just select what cut of meat, baked potato or mashed potatoes, and creamed spinach or creamed corn.  It will also come with a salad and yorkshire pudding. If you can't decide between a baked potato or mashed potatoes, I would recommend getting the baked potato first and then getting the mashed potatoes on your free second serving so you can try both.  You can do the same with the creamed corn and creamed spinach. If you want to make it to the free second serving, I don't recommend eating their bread.  I struggle with this because I really like their bread, but I always want to make it to the second slice. If you make a reservation, your whole party has to be there in order for you to be seated.  On special occasions like father's day, you can count on waiting even if you have a reservation.  However, I think it is well worth the wait! I always have a great time at House of Prime Rib!</review>

	<review>3 stars for the fact that it's called a "S.F. institution." yucks: -  CRAZY wait and no space to comfortably stand -  stanky joint!  didn't see too many there that night, so there must have been someone bathed in "eau de old people" -  felt like a meat market up in there, yo!  we were being herded all over the place. -  the famous corn bread and salad were a bit Sizzler-esque -  so that's what prime rib tastes like?  ehh... at least they had lots of condiments to liven up that hunk o' meat! -  i could've eaten LOTS more than the 1 1/2 slices i got (the 1/2 slice is paper-thin) oh.... okay... i'll give you that's: -  our waiter was a HOPR pro... you could tell he knew how to work it for tips -  the wine prices don't seem too hiked up -  we were near the meat carts, so i guess that's a perk to see where our food's coming from yay.  now i can say that i've gone to HOPR... life is complete.</review>

	<review>Okay so me and my girlfriend were coming back from watching the ballet and were craving for some prime rib. So where to go but the best place we knew and have been there a ton of times, House of Prime Rib. RIght? wrong. Once we parked we were greeted by wonderful hosts and seated promptly ( we called ahead with a reservation). BUT here is were everything went horrible. We waited for 5 mins which isnt bad but were approached by a RUDE server. He steps to our table and says "what do you want to order?". No "hi my name is so and so, how are you? hows your holidays", nothing! so me and my girlfriend look at each other and were WOW that's amazing approached without an intro and no a how are you. so we just push it aside and ask may we order drinks. He says "yeah we will get to that, what would you like to eat". so me and my girlfriend and i order and once we finish with my order he walks off without our drink order. At that point i pretty much lost my appetite. We didnt even get his name until we asked one of the other waiters who said his name is Jason. Overall it was such a horrible experience that it really ruined my image of House of Prime Rib. I was irritated because never in my times at such a wonderful restaurant was i treated so horribly. I can understand if you had a horrible night but you put that aside and move on. You are in the service industry. I worked in multiple restaurants, and whether it was a small restaurant to a high class restaurant in a 5 star hotel, you still have to give your utmost respect to your clients. I have been to House of Prime Rib multiple times and every time I get great service, that is why this one experience ruins my image of House of Prime. If people do go please avoid Jason as your server, I really would hate if he ruined your night as he ruined ours.</review>

	<review>I've been going here for years, but recently I've been left wanting. While you now seem to be seated near your reservation time, getting to your seat can be a bit of a hassle.  The restaurant feels overpacked between tables, staff, tray stands and the beef carts.  It almost appears as if more tables have been crammed into the restaurant creating a sardine like feel with a working factory level of noise.  Neither one are things I like to experience while dining. The sourdough bread seems to be the same as always.  The staff forgot to bring the cornbread even when reminded.  The salad appeared to be the same as it always has been but the dressing seemed looser and less flavorful. The beef itself was not as flavorful as in the past and seemed to have an excessive amount of fat.  The mash/gravy were about the same as always minus a bit of white pepper.  The creamed corn was more like coddled corn as it had been cooked so long it was like a yellow chunk sludge. Someone told my girlfriend that this place was quite romantic (my reaction was o.O).  I'm not sure where that started but with the over crowding, noise levels and lack of intimacy I can't see where such a thought came from. Service was OK but not up to the level I'm used to here.  Alas it would seem the bar is the only thing that still delivers the quality of days gone by.</review>

	<review>Sometimes I wish I lived in SF just so I can go to House of Prime Rib.   I always hear people say how expensive this place is, but come on now it is pretty freaking good and its PRIME RIB.  When is prime rib ever cheap? Salad is delicious, creme corn is delicious, creme spinach is delicious, and prime rib is sooooo freakin tender.  Bread kinda sucks in my opinion. Which cut should one get when they are seated?  The King Henry VIII cut of course.  I dont know why you would get any other cut.  It doesnt make sense to me.  The difference is only $1-4.  If you are eating here you might as well stock up your taste buds on this mouth watering prime rib.   I hear you can get seconds too~! Who does something like that?  It's so awesome I am going to get seconds the next time I go, even if I had to suffer later.</review>

	<review>Overrated and overpriced.  I have had better for a lot less.  The service and food quality also varies considerably between visits.  The decor and service carts are cool, but if you want a good steak dinner the  Steakhouses in rural California towns are a lot better and you pay a whole lot less.  Gino's Steakhouse in Colusa, CA is one such example.</review>

	<review>I am amazed! Seriously amazed! The service was great and the food was really good - actually way better than I expected. The beef was tender, juicy and flavorful. The au jus was delicious but a tad salty. I still loved it. Mashed potatoes gravy, creamed spinach all delicious. The salad and yorkshire pudding are included. It's a lot of delicious food. Of course they give you a tiny extra slice if you finish your initial portion of prime rib. 4 people with a bottle of wine, tax and tip, around $220. I think its one of the best deals in the city for the quality and amount of food. I can't wait to return.</review>

	<review>What could have started out as an underwhelming experience was saved by their excellent guest service. Boyfriend and I made a reservation for 7:30 Thursday night, which we arrived early for. We waited very patiently but did not get seated until around 8:25. I know, a bit long... but we didn't complain--it was our first time and the place was packed anyway so we were hoping it'd be worth it regardless. When we got seated we were immediately greeted by Valerie, our server. A manager then came up to our table and sincerely apologized for the wait. Wow, we really thought it would go unnoticed! That was very much appreciated. BF and I said no worries, but we could tell the manager didn't let things like that fly. He offered us either wine or dessert, on the house. Awesome!!! Good things come to those who wait :) The bread was great and the generous portion of salad was easily devoured. It was yum. I ordered the HoPR cut and he ordered the King Henry cut, both with mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. Oh my lordy... The prime rib was nothing short of amazing. Tender and melt-in-your mouth. Sides were delish, including the Yorkshire pudding. Valerie was great! Refilled our waters when needed and checked up on us. Very attentive and friendly, and always knew when we needed attention at the table. We were both stuffed, so for dessert we opted to just share the créme brulée. SO GOOD, such a perfect way to end dinner. Thank you for such a great experience. Will be back.</review>

	<review>Sadly unimpressive.  I stopped in thinking I would get the best prime rib experience of my life, and was sorely let down.  The Prime Rib travels around in a portable trolley, so it was cold.  The cut was bland as well.  I liked the sides for what it's worth - the cream of spinach rocked.. but it's not called House of Creamed Spinach.   Also, the waitstaff seemed bored.  Our server was good, but he was miserable.  You could tell he was counting the minutes to leave the restaurant.</review>

	<review>Norm from the 80's TV show "Cheers" would have loved this place! Next time you are in the mood for lots and lots of beef, look no further than HOPR. Along with your King Henry cut (enough for King Kong), you get the greatest house salad prepared in a gigantic bowl, potatoes in any form you can think of, Yorkshire Pudding and this fantastic creamed spinach. To top it off, if you are still not full, you can ask for a second helping.</review>

	<review>My immediate reaction walking into this place was, wow, maybe I should be wearing a top-hat and have a cane and be speaking with a british accent... Besides being a tad stuffy, the food was really good.  I love the prime rib, Yorkshire pudding, creamed spinach, etc.  If you get the small cut, it's cheaper and they come around and give you as many helpings as you want (although, I've never seen anyone go for seconds, at my table at least, and this is because of the monster salad they serve to you before hand). It's a good restaurant though, and keeps it classy! :)</review>

	<review>Fancy! You don't find me inside too many fancy restaurants, my cut-off jean shorts and Nascar hat hardly seem appropriate now. We came here last night with a large party (25+) and it was great. You don't get to pick from the menu in large groups, just pick a size and doneness. I went medium, medium and cleaned my plate. That's only because I'm one hell of a man who can eat a ton of red meat, it's kinda my thing. Anywho, beautiful restaurant, great staff, great food, great time. I had heard that if you can finish your food you could hint at getting more, not the case here, must be the large group think. They took Polaroid pictures for us as well, very nice. Would definitely take my girlfriend here, if I had one, which I don't.</review>

	<review>Okay, here is the deal. This is the only review you need to read. The service is excellent. The salad presentation and taste was great. Lot's of food with the sides of creamed spinach, bread pudding, bread, and corn bread, potatoes, etc.. They all were good. Great price for all of that included with your.meal. I was suprised after I ordered that I was getting all of that included. Well it all made sense after the prime rib came. It didn't have much flavor and was just average. No offense to people who think it's great. Plain and simple if you really know good meat you will realize that it's not that great. There are much better prime rib and steak houses out there, but it will cost you more..........</review>

	<review>I should have known, when I heard "HoPR"...it sounds WAY too much like "IHOP". **also the Yelp spell check thinks "HoPR" should be changed to "horrid"...maybe that's a sign. Make sure, when you make your reservation that you are not expecting to sit down until at least 15 minutes after your reservation time. (they should plan like southwest &amp; pad their ETAs). You will be seated in the lounge and given a little cup of some type of oriental bar mix, pretty good actually (maybe I was just hungry). You can order drinks while you are waiting and they will put it on your table tab. The decor is definitely old fashioned and conservative, but I guess you have to expect that from a steakhouse (well most). The prime rib is served to you from a big silver cart that looks like a mini version of an old fashioned 5th wheel. Carlos (I think that was his name) will carve it for you right there off of huge pieces of meat. If you are an indecisive person, you are in luck, because the only thing you get to choose is the size of your prime rib (or if you want fish). I take that back, you have to choose either creamed corn or creamed spinach, either mashed potatoes or a baked potato &amp; if you want MSG in your salad or not. The Verdict: Bread &amp; Butter - the best thing of the whole meal! Was a big sourdough round &amp; it was warm. Salad - tasted like a salad that you would get at a salad bar at a retirement home (sorry retired people!). Iceberg lettuce, dressing (tasted like thousand island, a lot of it), egg, strips of canned beets, pepper &amp; the seasoning salt that is on your table (MSG) if you choose. Did not like the salad. Prime rib - was OK, but nothing special &amp; was definitely not even close to the best beef I've had. It had a lot of sauce on it (I wouldn't call it gravy, was too watery). Creamed Corn - was overcooked, I like my corn crunchy! Creamed spinach - did not have a lot of flavor, as Jim Carey would say, "I've had better" Yorkshire Pudding - (made out of milk &amp; eggs) tasted like the dutch babies that I made in my 6th grade home EC class, was definitely interesting. The service was very friendly. Overall will cost you about $45 per person (+$ for drinks). You also get free sparkling water, sweeeeeet! I probably will not be going back unless a friend's birthday is there (apparently it is a popular spot for birthdays, "happy birthday" was sung 3 times during our dinner).</review>

	<review>I've gotten "ew" nose-wrinkles from people who hear about this restaurant and are vegetarians or not big meat-eaters, but here's a tip: It's called the House of Prime Rib. So expect meat -- delicious, delicious meat.  Their menu is fairly simple - you don't order really WHAT to eat so much as HOW MUCH to eat.  (There is technically a choice between prime rib and fish but who would ever come here to eat fish??) Each dinner comes with a salad with lettuce, beets and dressing.  I despise both beets and lettuce -- but this salad was delicious, as was the cornbread that came with it.  Then comes the prime rib - carved right in front of you - with sides of potato (baked/mashed), Yorkshire pudding, spinach (sautéed or creamed) or corn.  If you're still hungry, you're welcome to a complimentary second helping.  Plus, I liked watching our waiter (a very experienced and friendly man named Dennis) prepare everything in front of the table.  Their wine list is fairly good; Dennis made a great recommendation for a delicious Merlot that went wonderfully with the steak.   Reservations are an absolute must.  We had a reservation at 9pm, but weren't seated until about 9:20pm.  Luckily, the friendly bartender (Peter) kept us entertained and drinking.   I suggest coming here for your birthday.  The waiters all sing "Happy Birthday" in a very manly, macho voice; it's kind of hilarious.  They sang it to several groups in the room I was in, and I was sorely tempted to lie and tell them it was my birthday as well.</review>

	<review>Very touristy and also cheesy service and presentation. Our server did not know anything about the Fish of the evening (albeit it's not the most popular dish). However, he did't even know what fish they were even serving, but assured me that it was very fresh. As for the meat - very unsophisticated, even for a steakhouse. I mean come on, everything tastes better when you slather it with butter. If you want a nice beef dish on a special occasion you are better off going to Morton's or The Palm. As for my fish dish - one of the most ridiculous presentations I have EVER seen. They ruined a piece of fish that was otherwise cooked properly by smothering it in lemon butter sauce. Then to serve it on top of pile of mixed mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus (yes - they were combined together - clearly the chef has no concept of how to serve fish) and surround it with diced tomatoes?? I still don't understand what was going on. The large salad was served table side. The presentation was fun, but again, what the chef lacks in sophistication is made up by just throwing in some buttermilk. Also, the polaroid at the end of the meal was a bit embarrassing - we're not at Disney World after all. Try it because it's a San Francisco landmark, but reserve your special occasions for finer steak houses.</review>

	<review>Love this restaurant! I was so excited to come here for the first time. It took a little wait to get to our table, but the wait was so worth it and they had a full bar and seating where we were able to order drinks and chill while we waited for our table=) The service was excellent despite the busy night they were having. The salad and other sides were delicious and  best of all the Prime Rib was the SHIT! I've never had prime rib so juicy and yummy...and their servings were huge. It can be a bit pricey to eat here, but it's nice to come to and enjoy a delicious meal and hang out with good friends!</review>

	<review>House of Prime Rib? How about House of AWESOME!! This place is fantastic! Went here with a group of 7 on Saturday for my boyfriend's birthday, and was blown away from the moment we walked in the door. The caliber of service, with the extreme attention to detail was top notch, right down to the real silver dinnerware. Since all they do here is prime rib, the flavors of the meat are incredible. I almost needed to grab a mop to wipe up the drool when they wheeled the cart over to carve our cuts of meat table-side. And the portions were HUGE! Definitely a great place to go out for any special occasion. I highly recommend it.</review>

	<review>This is by far my favorite restaurant in the world and I come here for as many special occasions as possible!  Parking is not easy in this area so if you plan on not using valet, be sure to arrive early.  And it's true, even though you've got a reservation, you will still end up waiting.  Sometimes it's a five minute wait, sometimes it's a 25 minute wait.  The food is worth it.  We typically grab a seat or stand at the bar and enjoy a stiff cocktail while we wait.  Their drinks are on the pricey side but they are strong.  If you order something along the lines of a cosmo or lemon drop, they will make extra and serve that to you in a side glass.  (Yesssss!) We've always had amazing service here.  After ordering, the first thing you'll get is hot, fresh bread followed quickly by a table-side hand-tossed salad.  I crave this salad, it's delicious!  I don't like beets or some of the other ingredients, but trust me, when it's all tossed together in their rich and creamy dressing, you'll love it!   The prime rib here is tender, juicy, perfectly cooked and seasoned.  It's truly the best prime rib out there (and I've had a ton of prime rib).  If you finish your first plate, they will always offer to give you a second slice of the prime rib along with extra creamed spinach.   I've never had room for desert here, but if it's even half as good as the food, then I'm sure they are wonderful.  This restaurant is a class act, A+ place and I highly recommend it for locals and visitors alike.  Enjoy!</review>

	<review>The decor in this restaurant was very elegant and sophisticated; I believe it was a bank before, so the building has some beautiful architecture. The food was delicious; I've been to a lot of steakhouses, but this one takes the cake. The meat was tender and juicy and to top it off the waiters were very attentive. I will definitely return next time I am in the bay area.</review>

	<review>It was a tastegasm!  Wow, this was the best prime rib.  Fancy cooked with special rubs or sauces served on a perfectly appointed plate? Then this ain't for you. Love a perfectly cooked, don't need a knife or chew - You will love this prime rib.   My son and I ordered the House cut, hubby order the King cut.  Salad- hubby never likes beets on salad, loved this one. Wanted to finish the whole thing but had to save room.  Creamed spinach or corn- both soooo good.  Mashed potato - hubby wouldn't let me taste, too good to share. Baked potato - yum!  Yorkshire Pudding is the perfect au jus sopper.  Prime rib, oh, prime rib was perfect. Tried all 3 horseradish sauce, like spicy, but actually liked the texture and taste of mild the best. Oh, and the sourdough bread.  The boys had the rest of the loaf for dessert!</review>

	<review>House of Prime Rib is probably my favorite restaurant!  The food is so good, you forget about how early in advance you had to make your reservation to beat everyone else and the occasional wait before you're seated while they prepare your table. I always get the English cut, which I believe is three thinly sliced pieces of prime rib cut so you can enjoy the flavor.  There isn't anything I don't like about the food here.  The salad and their special house dressing is unique and delicious.  The meat is always cut from the right places so you always get the level of rarity you want.  The service you receive is very good and the employees all interact with you, whether it's saying hello or asking if you enjoyed your meal. Sometimes service can be a little slow, but it's obviously not going to be quick when you're serving a full house every night.  My boyfriend and I like to come here for special occasions, whether it's our birthdays, anniversary, or Valentine's day (the waiters/waitresses give out roses to the ladies).  House of Prime Rib is pricey, so we try our best to curb our temptations!</review>

	<review>The prime rib is really good.  It is the best I've had so far.  Plus the mash potatoes, spinach, york shire pudding, red wine, corn, bread, salad = instant fullness.  If you are a big eater, this is the  place to go.  And if you are still hungry, you can ask for seconds (s smaller, thinner slice of prime rib).  I must say its a good place for family and friends.  But for a romantic date, I wouldn't suggest it.  I went on a Tuesday and it was so packed and loud.  We literally were screaming at each other.  And there is this old man, I'm thinking he's the manager, that goes around and asks you how your dinner is.  But he is so quiet and he really doesn't wait for you to respond.  He just walks away.  I mean the attempt is nice but if you really don't mean it then it will show.  However, the service was okay and the prime rib is yummy!</review>

	<review>I can't believe I've lived in the City my whole life and I only just made it here for the first time. The other reviews have covered it pretty well, all 1100+ of them, so I'll just chime in and say it's in contention for one of my top favorites. Service was excellent on our visit, though the server did seem to have a large section and at least one drunkenly boisterous table (not me for once). Considered taking a star away because we did have a reservation, showed up on time, and waited in the lounge for about twenty minutes.  The lounge was nice, we were called before we could finish a cocktail, and the food deserves every bit of that fifth star.  So top rating.  Highly recommended.</review>

	<review>I've been here a few times, but prefer to pick other places to dine for a quieter atmosphere. This place is definitely NOT dressy and apparently is GREAT for kids. People come here in jeans and a t-shirt. I literally saw someone in windbreakers here once. Kids run rampant everywhere (ok, maybe not rampant, but there are lots of those little creatures here). There is little space. Maybe I'm just here on the wrong nights? What I do like about this place: 1) Side are really good. I love the creamed spinach/corn 2) Rather large portions.</review>

	<review>Been here a few times and i think this place is over priced because their prime rib isn't as good as everyone says they are. I mean, if you are a big meat eater, you would definitely love this place because you can have seconds, thirds, or even fourths if you can handle it. Their service is not that great and I rather go to a place that is more expensive with better food than this place.</review>

	<review>I've only seen more birthdays go down in a single evening at Chevy's, another local favorite of mine. :) The House completely reminds me of supper clubs back home. I eat big slabs of red meat only once in a blue moon, because, according my female coworkers, I'm a manorexic. Well, if that's the case I felt like Karen Carpenter here because I certainly am not used to stuffing that much food in my gullet. I thought my martini was well made, had a good cut of meat and a nice salad but was just kind of underwhelmed by the whole experience. Maybe when I'm older and 50 pounds heavier, I'll be able to enjoy this place with the red-blooded American gusto it so deserves. Until then, I'll keep eating my rice cakes.</review>

	<review>I came here to HoPR a few Mondays ago with a few friends. They all have been here before, but it was my first time. The place was pretty busy but we had reservations at 7:30 and we walked in at about 7:23ish and we were seated by 7:28ish so that was a plus! Right when i sat down i looked over my shoulder and guess who was eating right next to us? Good ol Willie Brown ex-Mayor of the City, it looked like he was a regular because they treated him like a king! Lets get on with the food, i ordered the HoPR cut which came with a real nice piece of prime rib and a side of creamed spinach. I have to say that was the best creamed of spinach i have ever had, so much flavor my taste buds were on overload! They started us out with a house salad, i think they put way too much dressing on the salad. The corn shaped cornbread was pretty good, and the Yorkshire Pudding was real good too. My baked potato was just another baked potato, nothing special. But as for my prime rib, O' boy that was a great piece of meat. It was melt in your mouth greatness with a great beefy flavor. Overall HoPR is a must try, great place to have a real nice dinner. If the cuts you order is not enough you can also get a second helping at no additional charge! 4 Stars for HoPR in SF</review>

	<review>My husband and I went for our second time this past weekend for a friend's birthday.  The majority of the people in our group haven't been to HOPR so this was a great opportunity for them to try it.  I hope they liked it because we hyped this place up! Our first time around I ordered my prime rib à la carte (succulent slices of beef) and enjoyed that meal thoroughly. This past weekend I got the City Cut (a smaller cut for the lighter appetite).  The meat just seemed okay to me, nothing spectacular, but still good nonetheless.   Next time I want to try the English cut (thin slices of prime rib).  Perhaps that cut is the one for me. Average price for the different cuts is about $35 per person.  Each entrée comes with salad, choice of mashed potatoes or baked potato, yorkshire pudding, fresh creamed spinach or corn, and fresh mild, medium, hot horseradish sauces.  All very delicious and complimentary to your perfectly cooked meat.  If you still have room for more, you have a choice of ordering a second plate of prime rib.  No thirds though; my husband got denied!   Service is always impeccable here.  I couldn't complain about that if I tried.   At the end of our meal, our waiter took a picture of our group, printed it out and handed to the birthday boy in a little frame.  Sweet. Reservations are highly recommended!</review>

	<review>I absolutely love the prime rib there along with the sides that come with it. It was Thursday night and we made a reservation for 8 however it still took quite a while to get a table so if you plan to go with a large group I would recommend splitting them up into 2 groups. The owner of place personally apologized to us for the long wait and offered us the choice of free drinks or desert.  We choose desert. Our cute server who looks like Mischa Barton was very  pleasant and attentive to our needs. I enjoyed the salad and fresh bread, it really got our appetite going. We all ordered the King Henry size cut of prime rib and was site to behold. A giant cut of tender perfectly cooked prime rib with Au jous, creamed spinach and mashed potatoes on the side. There was also creamy and spicy horseradish for dipping. We all just felt the urge to capture this moment so we took pictures of our food with our camera phones. Almost all of us were able to finish our prime rib. For those who couldn't finish  the waiters helped package the leftovers for us . They also did a great job refilling our drinks right away without us having to ask so we were never thirsty. At this point I was so looking forward to desert to finish off our delicious meal. Our server recommended  the creme brulee, which most of us decided to order. The rest ordered the fresh strawberries with cream. What a great way to finish, my stomach was happy as could be. We all left with big smiles and a nice tip.</review>

	<review>I love the idea of prime rib carved in front of me and also getting me seconds if i still have room. The bread and salad here are very good!  For prime rib, I recommend the English cut cus it's so juicy and thinly sliced.  Spinach cream is good as well as the pudding thing.  Ambience of this place is cozy and warm.  It doesn't open for lunch.  Dinner usually requires a reservation a couple of weeks in advance since they fill up quite fast, even if you're going during the week.</review>

	<review>I have been hearing about this restaurant for awhile and it was delicious. I am a big fan of prime meat. I have been to Lawry's in Beverly Hills many times. So I really wanted to see the best prime rib SF had to offer. Lawry's in Beverly hills opened in 1928. House of prime opened in 1949. I find it crazy ironic that the menu's are similar and even the way they chill the salad and spin it is similar. But overall that's how the restaurant business operates in my opinion; they take an idea and replicate it with their own twist. The prime rib was amazing. I got mine medium-rare and it was so tender it melted in my mouth. The chef makes prime rib look like art.  The sides are simple yet the flavors of the cream corn and spinach make my mouth salivate.  The sourdough bread was so delicious it was recognizable= its Boudin's bread heat &amp; serve. Service was excellent. The restaurant seemed like every birthday and bachelor party was celebrating in all of San Francisco but that cant take away from the experience of one of the best prime ribs I have ever eaten.</review>

	<review>went there a few days ago. food is great but dont expect mouth watering steak! the steak is not that big so don't worry you're not paying $32-$37 for a big chunk of steak.  my suggestions for the menu: order: medium steak, baked potato, creamed corn, and try the biscuit although its a lil bitter.  salad is good but i didnt like the beets they had in there though.  do not get  well done meat because it will taste like rubber!</review>

	<review>If you're feeling old and crusty like me and want some way other than a visit to a skilled nursing facility to make you appreciate your youth, go have dinner at the House of Prime Rib.  A midweek dinner at this San Francisco institution really restored a newfound appreciation for my 35 year old body and my very own set of teeth.  Looking around the main dining room I was surprised by the patrons who either didn't age well and were really a haggard and tired looking bunch of 40 year olds, or most of the diners were really 60 and above.  In fact I was so taken aback by the skewed demographic that I almost anticipated the house salad to be pureed in a blender for easier digestion rather than mixed in a bowl.   I opted for the English cut prime rib which was thinly sliced and excellent with the creamy spicy horseradish and my sides of creamed spinach, Yorkshire pudding and loaded baked potato.  By the way, this meal would have fed a small village in a third world country so I suggest fasting before you partake of this gluttonous feast.   Pru chose the King Henry VIII cut which he finished right to the bone.  I was impressed and a little afraid that a mere mortal could have polished off, well, a cow in one sitting.  The HOPR folks apparently recognize this as a rare talent so their policy is to give you yet another smallish FREE serving of prime rib to reward this feat.  And as for the taste and quality of the freebie, Pru reports that you get what you pay for.   The loaded baked potato was a meal in itself, actually two meals (I'll be having the other half for dinner tonight) made tableside and topped with chives, sour cream, butter and bacon.  The tossed salad was also made tableside--it was fascinating to watch the waiter spinning the bowl like a DJ on a turntable.  My Grey Goose vodka dirty martini was served with the cocktail shaker it was shaken in so I actually got three martinis for a paltry $9.50.  At the end of the night and after three dirty martinis, the salad bowl wasn't the only thing spinning.  For desert, the Grand Marnier infused berry trifle was a great light ending to a very heavy meal.  Expect to spend about $100-$140 for a dinner for two including drinks and a shared desert.</review>

	<review>I took my boyfriend here after losing a bet. It felt like a trip into Mad Men and was looking for smoking rooms hidden in the back. The service was fantastic and it's definitely something to do at least once in San Francisco. However, the food wasn't as good as I was expecting. The portions were large and as the meat is not served a la carte unless you specify it comes with spinach or creamed corn, choice of potato, yorkshire pudding, salad, and bread. While the Prime Rib was good, I don't think it was as good as I could have gotten for $19.99 at the local steakhouse (also named "The Prime Rib") in my native Gillette, Wyoming. The mashed potatoes tasted like they were instant and there was nothing special about the creamed spinach. I liked the yorkshire pudding but only because it was different. For $180 dollars (two prime rib dinners and a bottle of wine)</review>

	<review>I was really disappointed when I came here. A friend had booked a table for 9pm to celebrate his birthday with a few friends. We were all hungry and waited in the front. Our table was not ready until just after 10pm and then we had a really slow waiter. So the food ended up arriving at 10:45pm. That was the first disappointment. The second disappointment was that it easily must have been the worst meat I've ever eaten. Apparently Prime Rib is not for everybody. My cut was really greasy and I had to pick and cut out the 'edible' parts of meat and had to create a big mess on the plate. Some of my friends' cuts were a little better but in general I am not convinced of the quality. The Yorkshire Pudding was probably the most tasteful thing I had that night - the spinach and the mashed potatoes were just bland. Not going back there if I can avoid it.</review>

	<review>Came here with my boyfriend since he had a gift certificate. We didn't expect there to be a lot of food and we arrived too early for our reservation, so we ate a crepe nearby before coming here. Often booked weeks in advance, it's definitely not a place you just drop by on a whim. It's a place you probably want to dress up for, and you'd think it'd have an intimate ambiance with the dim lights and all, but it's actually pretty loud. The service is excellent here, as everyone has lauded. They serve both sparkling water and regular water and do a great job of explaining the menu. They actually got my order wrong but hey, it's still prime rib, so I didn't complain. We were overwhelmed by the amount of food that came out. The sides are not super special, but the salad and the baked potatoes (both assembled in front of you) were pretty good. Creamed spinach was not my cup of tea at all. We each ate maybe 1/4-1/3 of our prime rib and had the rest packed up. We had 2 bagfuls of leftovers, which served us for the next 2 meals! Crazy. Great place for prime rib, but if there are other places, I would probably want to compare first.</review>

	<review>The House of Prime Rib allows me to celebrate in all things American: excessive portions, strong alcoholic drinks, and our national obsession with red meat.  It's one of those meals that your body certainly can't handle to indulge in everyday.  But exercised in moderation, a meal at House of Prime Rib feeds much more than your current appetite - it provides vivid food memories for months to come. Notes and Tips: 1) One drink order is equivalent to 2 glasses full.  If you're not a heavy drinker, order one drink for two people.   2) Get the baked potato over mashed potatoes. 3) Second slice of prime rib is complimentary so ask for it!  You usually aren't allowed to take the second slice home, but who is to object really. 4) Yorkshire pudding is savory and most definitely does not resemble the dessert pudding of your imagination.  (If anything, it is more akin to naan.) 5) Open Table is not always an accurate portrayal of what reservations are available especially during prime dinner times.  Give the restaurant a call! 6) They will take a photo for you on birthdays and special occasions.  Just ask!</review>

	<review>Came here to celebrate my birthday this year. Was 15 minutes early for my reservation at 9PM. Did not get my table until 9:20PM. Overall, prime rib was mediocre. I feel like it used to taste better years ago. Is it just me, or do they seat most Asians and other minorities in the dark, back-side of the restaurant? Everytime I come here, I get seated in the back, and I am Asian.</review>

	<review>I came here with 2 boys. I had one piece of meat. I ate all my bread and salad. I honestly don't know what all the fuss is about with prime rib. It was just red meat to me. I didn't really like the atmosphere. For the price I would rather a fusion restaruant with flavors popping from every dish. If you like meat, meat and more meat, this is the place for you!</review>

Yeah, they wheel it around on a metal cart and slice it off for you right infront of your eyes, but I've had better. Maybe I had a terrible waiter so made things</review>

	<review>I love house of prime rib! I've been here about 8 times. Huge portions and they even give you a free slice when you finish your first one! What more can you want? I usually walk out of here slower than I did walking in. I think thats common after eating 5 pounds of food!.. haha. When I feel like indulging myself with good food, a good environment and great service I always think of House of Prime Rib. You cant go wrong with anything you order here!</review>

	<review>I'm not a very big meat person but I still wanted to try this place out. They serve you sour dough bread with a cube of butter when you're seated. I got the House of Prime Rib cut, and it was okay. It came with a plate of salad, corn bread, I chose the baked potato instead of the mashed, got the cream of corn instead of the cream of spinach, and they also gave the Yorkshire pudding. I didn't think it was spectacular or anything, but the ambiance was nice. Their service there was okay. It went really well in the beginning but we were there past 10pm and our server disappeared on us. We had to ask 2 different people for our bill.</review>

	<review>Imagine Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union when you had to wait in lines for 2 hours to get a piece of bread.  Identical experience.   Reservations are pointless, front staff are liars, they kept telling us our table was "getting set up", what the F... it takes 50 minutes to set up a table for two? The Prime Rib was mediocre to say the least- King Henry VIII would have sent the cook to the guillotine. This one star is for our server from Spain for being nice.</review>

	<review>Ever since I've moved to SF 2.5 years ago, I've been to HOPR 7 times and have not been disappointed.  For ~$35 a person (not including drinks), you get so much food including an appetizing salad with homemade dressing (I never eat salad, but love this one), yorkshire pudding, two sides, and your cut of prime rib.   Now if you eat a lot, like me, you may want morefood...They don't openly tell you this (at least my waiter didn't), but you can ask for seconds for free!!!  Great food for the price!</review>

	<review>After a long day of hard physical labor, We rewarded ourselves with HOPR tonight. We got there pretty early at 6:30 and was seated within 5 minutes. By 7pm the place was completely full even on a monday night. The server was exceptional and expressed fine dining proffesional service. I ordered the English cut, which is thinner slices of price rib. I prefer the thinner slices because it seems offer more flavor.  The famous house salad was fantastic and consistent with all the other times I dined here.  Accompanied with my prime rib was mash potato and creamed spinach. I asked for more au jus and my prime rib was just absorbing it up. After the my plate was polished clean, the server asked us if we would like a second helping. (additional prime rib, sides, etc. are complimentary) How can I turn that down? I asked for a thin slice of beefy goodness and some more mash potatoes. I have dined here countless times, and have yet to ever have any negative experiences. HOPR is  just top-notch in my book. I'm in a total prime rib comatose. I'm gonna sleep so well tonight!

	<review>My previous experience @ HOPR (about 2 years ago) was great so I was looking forward to sharing my great experience with my family.  Unfortunately my experience this time around was extremely disappointing, primarily due to the wait time to get seated. Since we had a party of 7, we made a 7pm reservation thru OpenTable for Thursday 4/21/2011.  Once we got there, I was surprised at how busy it was - I must have come on a off night previously because I don't recall it being that busy or loud.  Anyhow, you would think that with a 7pm RESERVATION that we would get seated relatively quickly but IT TOOK AN HOUR TO GET SEATED!!!  WTF?!  Sure, 7 people isn't a small party but THAT"S WHY WE MADE THE RESERVATION!  Being on OpenTable and taking reservations, I would think HOPR would know how to deal with reservations but it seemed like they had no clue!  We constantly checked on the progress of our table with the host but he kept saying 5 minutes . . . if it's really going to be longer than 5 minutes, I'd rather be told of the actual time estimate even if it is longer rather than being given lip service to try to make me feel better!  It was 40 minutes in that the host finally told me the silverware on our table was being placed.  SERIOUSLY??? Once we were seated for our meal, our server Steve did take care of us and the food didn't disappoint.  The cuts of meat were great so yes, HOPR gets 5 stars for its food, and I'll give the service 4 stars (minus 1 star as sometimes service was a little slow eg drinks took a while to get refilled).  All in all, if you love prime rib, HOPR is a must . . . hopefully, you won't have to suffer through waiting to get seated like we had to this time around!</review>

	<review>I'm flabbergasted by the drooling reviews of the meat here.  It's ok.  The presentation is awful - don't look into the giant rolling meat wagon or the sight of pale fat, grayish gristle and strangely light beige meat mounds will put you off your sauce.  It was Father's Day, and my favorite father in the whole world (my son) just had to have the HOPR full effect.  Like everyone else, we waited for over 30 minutes despite the reservation.  We were so terrified by the Yelp warnings that no one in your party better be off taking a leak when your number comes up that we huddled together near the bar, clutching each other tightly.   My daugher in law (DIL) checked on our reservation after 30 minutes and found out that another party had answered when her name was called. And her last name isn't Smith or Lee. On the website it states that the children's meal is 10.95 for 10 and under.  It's not.  It's 11.95 for 8 and under.  My oldest granddaughter scrunched her chest hoping she could pass for 8, which she did. Phew.  By the way, the children's meal comes with milk and ice cream, so make sure you check your bill - we were charged extra, and felt like cheapskates making a big deal about it, considering how freakin' expensive this place is.  But it's the principle. Because of the name mix-up, my DIL guilt-tripped them into letting her take her second slice home, although the waiter, terrified, had to clear it with "management".  (Who are all those men in black suits, anyway?  And yeah, the little old guy is great, if not a bit rote.) I liked our waitperson.  He tried really hard not to show how frustrated we were making him, but I caught a grimace between the gentle smiles. I don't think it was us.  That place was packed to the gills. The spinach - great.  My cornbread came in the shape of male genitals, minus one testicle.  Can't rate the potato because it was impossible to find room for it.  The mashed potatoes on other's plates tasted just like mashed potatoes. For Mother's day, we went to Cattleman's, and even though we had to send back two of our orders (cold meat, eww), the meat had actual flavor, was about $10.00 cheaper, and the atmosphere was way more corny, in a good way.  Plus they gave all the ladies a rose and a coupon for our next visit.     What else?  oh, yeah, the salad.  I was expecting the salad to be some kind of awakening with all the good reviews here.   The dressing reminded me of my mother's version of french - mayo and ketchup mixed together.  Not quite sure what makes the julienned beets such a dealmaker,either.   But my 2 year old granddaugher practically licked her plate, and my son loved it, so maybe I'm missing the point. It's unlikely I'll ever go back here by choice, but my son's been here half a dozen times, and he loves prime rib, so it's possible that I am not the best judge of meat.  Atmospherically, it's swell. One more thing - I don't know if there's more than one, but the ladies room on the ground floor consists of two toilets and one sink.  There was a line out the door.  It's unseemly, I tell ya.</review>

	<review>prime rib was very good for most, but the medium rare one  I got was kinda tough,  so it is hit and miss, service was there whenever you want something, but there was a sense of hustle and bustle throughout the dinner. not really fine dining, kinda loud and lots of activity, but the prime rib is very good.</review>

	<review>I've been dining at the House of Prime Rib for over 40 years, since I was a kid. We've been coming into the city for special occasions and celebrations there for decades, as did our parents and grandparents. A week ago, we brought my sister, visiting from DC, over to the HPR, and were shocked at the transformation it's undergone, from being an elegant, sophisticated upscale dining experience, to a CATTLE DRIVE, and that's no pun. What an offensive experience. Our table was a joke - 6 of us were crammed into a table barely big enough for our place settings, I asked for a roomier table, since it seemed that our table was really better suited for 4 people, but they told us we'd have to wait again. I can't believe they think it's okay to cram people in like that, or place the tables so close to each other that there's no privacy and the room is so loud you have to raise your voice to be heard. I have to say, the main course was just as good as always, but the wait for our dinner, then our dessert, was unacceptable. 20+ minutes for each. I won't pay that kind of money for such a lousy dining experience again. Even the nicest waitstaff can't overcome being mobbed and understaffed. I'm so disappointed that this icon from my childhood has become such a sub-pedestrian dining experience. Really really too bad.</review>

	<review>When I went here I seriously felt like ROYALTY with the amazing flavor, tenderness, and juicy richness of the flavor of the prime rib. I really think this place is so good that I'd dub it a new word... PRIME RIB-A-LICIOUS! I ordered the House of Prime Rib cut and the portion was quite sufficient and very filling. I feel that they cook their beef in a way that it melts in your mouth. And the side dishes? An extra perk that is delicious as well! I loved all the side dishes that came with our meal and it was actually my first time having the Yorkshire Pudding - which was a wonderful and amazing addition to our meal. My impression is that you really do have to make reservations for this place. It made my visit a whole lot easier and smooth. Just visit their site and a quick set of clicks will get you your reservation to deliciousness. I loved the atmosphere here and it was great for a date. Though I may note that the time I went it was packed so their was some noise from the surrounding families. The service I got was great. Our server had a great sense of humor and a great helpful personality. I think that with the whole package is definitely worth the price in my opinion. I've only been here once but honestly, I CANNOT wait to go again and am salivating just thinking about it! :)</review>

	<review>HOPR is pretty decent. Great service, excellent sides for sure. As an overall meal it is a good value as it includes a good  salad + corn or spinach + mashed or baked potato + yorkshire pudding. The prime rib is just above average. Perhaps my expectations for the prime rib were high, but the place IS called House of Prime Rib! Still a good dinner.</review>

	<review>I love prime rib. My family used to regularly go to Mr Steer in Santa Clara for their prime rib special before it changed owners and eventually closed down. I've heard great things about HOPR from coworkers and random street folks so I figured my birthday was as good a time as any to check it out. The BF made reservations for 8:30 and we arrived a few minutes early. Like other reviews have stated, we were asked to take a seat in the lounge while we waited for our table. Nearly 30 min had passed when the floor manager approached us, apologized for the wait and offered to comp us a round of cocktails. Since the BF doesn't really drink he was offered a free dessert. Not 5 seconds later were we seated. Hot sourdough was delivered to the table, which I tried to refrain from eating, but who can resist hot bread and butter? Next came MORE BREAD, but this time it was a delicious jalapeno corn bread in the shape of a corn on the cob. Then salad, which contained eggs and beets, not two of my favorite foods. One taste and I was sold, it's one of the best salads that I've had! From this point on the night is pretty much a blur of meat, pinot noir and potatoes. I got the English cut and the BF got the HOPR cut. I liked how the thin slices soaked up more au jus. The meat was sooo tender and flavorful. The mashed potatoes were perfect, and I'm super picky about my mash. Yorkshire pudding soaked in gravy and jus, OMG mouthgasm for sure! For dessert I chose the English trifle, which is essentially berries and cream with little cakes soaked in Grand Marnier. They brought it out to me with a candle and sang happy birthday and took our picture with a polaroid camera. The BF got the tiramasu, his dessert of choice and proclaimed it delicious. In short: Food - A-freakin-mazing Service- wonderful Atmosphere- a little loud but cozy Can't wait to take my family here!</review>

	<review>Dear House of Prime Rib, I really wanted to like you. After all, I moved away from LA and effectively it's outstanding prime rib restaurant, Lawry's. I expected to come here, the city of "foodies" hoping to keep a prime rib joint close to my heart as I had in LA. *sigh* I will layout the review in bad points then alternately give a good point. You disappointed me. Your unusually long wait time, even for reservations strikes me as careless. Why even bother having a reservation system if you're going to make people wait an hour after their designated time? This would have never happened at Lawry's. Even so, at Lawry's you would be able to temper your stomach with some delicious meatballs and potato chips as complimentary appetizers for waiting. There was no such complimentary appetizer here. The mixed nuts at the bar were okay. As soon as we arrived at our table, we were greeted with a nice, enthusiastic server. But it all went downhill from there. I noticed that the menu didn't have creamed corn but it does exist as the waiter informed me. The creamed corn and creamed spinach were nothing to write home about. It tasted under seasoned and mushy, nothing like Lawry's flavorful sides.  Its a good thing these come with your meal because I would not have paid A La Carte for these items. They don't have mushrooms like they do at Lawry's. Big downer. Like Lawry's, the server tried to dazzle us with his amazing array of salad dressing dousing and bowl spinning maneuvers but failed because the salad became uber-saturated with dressing and it was missing some baby tomatoes. The saturation could have been minimized if it had copied Lawry's technique of putting something dry in the salad, say CROUTONS. However, I did like the beats. I ordered the House of Prime Rib cut, medium rare.  This is important because I only eat red meat medium rare!  Low and behold, the quality assurance team at HOPR was sleeping at the time and I received a well-done cut. This meant that both the "Chef" and the server both neglected to check how done the meat was before bringing it back to me.  Fail. No matter, I figured I would just mention it to my server and it should be fixed in a jiffy. Nope. My girlfriend was about 5 minutes into her cut while I was watching my server plead with the old man for permission to re-cut (who looks like the Godfather of the restaurant) and then talk to the "Chef" who cut me my re-vised piece. Then finally, the server came back to my table and neatly presented me my new plate, with an insultingly smaller cut than I had before and in addition forgot to replace my Yorkshire pudding from the previous plate (which was uneaten!).  I don't understand how carelessness can be a trend at a traditional prime rib restaurant lauded by so many and for so many years. Oh and to top it off again, the old man (Godfather) came by my table with a snooty expression asking almost sarcastically how my new cut was and didn't bother stopping to listen as I was answering him.   The only things HOPR had going for it were the hot baked bread and the complimentary seconds which I wasn't even asked for after I finished my insulting re-cut.  Oh I almost forgot about the slap in the face that they charged me for the House of Prime Rib Cut when surely the re-cut was a City Cut or "seconds" cut. Like Arnold Schwarenegger would say on opposite day (except I mean it) "I won't be back." HOPR, if you feel that you did not do me wrong, please let me know how you want to salvage our relationship.</review>

	<review>While I am not typically a huge fan of prime rib, this place does it better than any other that I have visited.  The service is always great and the value is decent considering everything you get.  For us men, the King Henry cut is the only way to go.  For a reasonable price (a little less than $40) you get a table mixed dinner salad, great sourdough bread and of course your prime rib with a choice of two kinds of potato and spinach or corn.  You also get something similar to a dutch baby, which they call Yorkshire pudding.  If you finish this slab of meat and you're still hungry, you can get seconds.  Thats right, seconds of meat and sides.  I cannot think of another place that will give you all of that  for less than $40 and the atmosphere is comfortable. Great San Francisco place to eat</review>

	<review>That yorkshire pudding/bread is simply amazing! I have never had anything like it. It's light and fluffy and you eat it like bread yet it's moist and airy inside and crispy on the outside. The cornbread and sourdough bread is good too. I'm really not a big meat eater so I can't comment on the meat but it was tender and juicy umm Their salad was simple yet tasty too. Try it with pepper! Their creamed corn/creamed spinach selection was a little "meh" for me. I would have preferred something healthier. Their gravy and mashed potatoes was slightly on the watery side too. They give generous portions in wine by the glass. I had 1 glass and it lasted me through the entire night somehow. I'd give this place 4.3 stars.  Rounding up to 5 ;)</review>

	<review>I came here last week for my bday and we had reservations, it was early (4:30) because that was the only slot they had available. When we got there we were seated right away and greeted by our waiter. I selected the english cut with a side of mashed potatoes and creamed spinach and my bf got the king henry with mashed potatoes and creamed corn. The salad was really good! and the rest was appetizing. The red wine that the waiter selected for me went well with our meal. Overall I enjoyed my experience here. As time went on, the place did fill and gradually got a little louder, but it wasn't too bad.</review>

	<review>First time here but have been to Lawry's a couple times in LA and heard they are kinda the same. The inside of the restaurant was a little chaotic being so packed and congested. With reservation, we still had to wait 1/2 hour at the bar before we were called. The whole sourdough bread was piping hot, has the most crunchy crust and had really sour and moist center. I ate almost all the crust of that poor thing and almost stuffed myself to death before the salad even came out. The house salad was smothered in way too much "thousand island-like' dressing. Other than that, it tasted pretty good with eggs in it and the iceberg looked very fresh. There were a lot of beets in it but I couldn't taste it since it was so dredged in dressing. They did not put any seafood item on the menu but the server told me they only had salmon and sea bass. When I asked if they had lobster, he looked at me like I am being too demanding being at a prime rib restaurant, but I asked because I saw that on Lawry's menu before. As a shameless non-prime rib eater who usually orders seafood at a restaurant like this, this was the 1st time I asked for 2nd and 3rd bite when my boyfriend cut me a small piece to try. And I might be finally converted to order a piece of my own next time I return. I also like the way they give you all 3 kinds of horseradish to choose from. (well not different kinds, but kinda different spiciness). According to my boyfriend, his piece of Henry VIII cut was tender, and that was the 1st time I heard him say that! I am not sure why they have to discriminate, but the prime rib dinner all comes with mashed potatoes with gravy, cremed spinach or corn. However, my sea bass only came with some inedible fried "alfafa" and mashed potatoes without gravy. Everyone gets the Yorkshire pudding. At first bite, the sea bass seemed very well seared with a crunchy crust but I felt like it was actually greasy and heavy after a few bites. Since the sea bass already has so much fat content, I think that was totally unnecessary to abuse the piece of fish like that. The cut was kinda thick and I suspected the center wasn't completely cooked because it was hard to poke through. Even though I am a person who would normally eat anything green on my plate, I had to dish out those fried "alfafa things" because they tasted like raw grass and were too tough to chew on. I also asked for a side of cremed corn but it was not good at all (nothing like the one at Lawry's). They tasted completely overcooked and did not have any sweetness. The cremed spinach wasn't good either, overcooked and very much like baby food. The mashed potatoes were decent, the gravy was pretty good. The Yorkshire pudding was actually cooked to perfection. The center was super creamy and the outside was very crispy. It was delivered piping hot in a small cast iron pan. However, I don't understand who can possibly eat that much food with all these bread, side dishes, big salads, and big entrees. I was actually surprised and excited to see so many items on their dessert menus. I had to go with the English Trifle since I don't see it often in here. There were a lot of fresh berries in it but there wasn't enough sauce for the taste. And I could barely taste the Grand Maniere in it. The dessert looked good but it was not easy to dig into that wine glass with a standard length spoon. The bill came to about $120 (with beers) and I think this is probably as good as a prime rib dinner can get. No wonder this place was mentioned by Anthony Bourdain and in food network's "The best things I've ever eaten".</review>

	<review>Call for reservations because you'll have a long wait. I called to ask for the dress attire and they person over the phone told me its casual. Just no beach wear, athletic wear, or flip flops. So there's no need to dress up when you don't have to. For being a semi fine dining I felt like giving a four is a little much. Street parking and valet are your only options. The decor was decent. As I approached the reservations area the staff was on the phone. The hostess next to him just stood there. I didn't get greeted. Until he got off the phone and asked me for my information and asked me to wait for my table to be ready at the bar. But have you ever gotten a bad vibe? I felt like they looked at me as if they were too good for me. I brushed it off because I've heard so many good comments about this place through friends and of course the reviews were good. I didn't want to ruin the mood of the night since I hyped it up so much for my other friends and we were visiting from out of town. We finally got seated a party of five. The place seemed awfully cramped. I say this because the table behind us was literally like half an arm length away. The waitress was trying to serve that table and she spilled stuff over my boyfriend shirt and his jacket. Although she apologized and wiped it off. The manager only offered to pay for dry cleaning. Which we have to mail to him the bill. I mean that's the best you can do? Really? If we were really mean people, we would've thrown a hissy fit. But I would've thought a discount on our food or free dessert. But nope. When the meal was done, they were clearing the table the server almost spilled the leftover au jus sauce on my boyfriend. As for the main server that was serving us. I had to ask for refill on our water. I've never ate at a fine dining and had to continuously refill my own water cup. The boyfriend ordered his prime rib medium rare and it was medium. The way they prepare the salad and baked potatoes in front of you is intriguing to watch. After reading other yelp reviews, stating that we would get offered another slice of prime rib if we finished our meal and upon ordering we did ask the  server who also stated that, that information we heard was in fact to be true  and we never got offered anything after we were done. And we ordered four king size prime ribs. The cream corn is nothing compared to Mastro's or Lawry's. They put a lot of sour cream on the baked potatoes. The prime rib was decent. The au jus sauce made it tasty. Instead of getting the standard cut might as well pay $2 extra and get the king size prime rib. You could take it to go if you don't finish your meal. They pack it up for you as you sit at your table. They take reservations. The bathroom is behind some type of curtains. Your dinner comes with salad, mashed or baked potatoes, Yorkshire pudding, the prime rib, and cream corn or cream spinach. I'm sorry. But House of Prime RIb... you definitely did not win this party of 5 over. I should have know from my first gut feeling when your male hostess who was on the phone was giving me a bad vibe. Who am I to leave you such a bad review? I'm truthful about my visit. I'm sure that you don't treat everyone with this type of service. Perhaps because I look young, I'm Asian, I'm under dressed? Whatever the case may be, you have left a very negative experience for me. As I return for future visits to San Francisco. You definitely will not be on my to visit list.</review>

	<review>This place is freaking awesome. I had to do some Yelp research the first of the year because my brother had come to visit me from Texas. He's a meat and taters guy so all my faves were out: no sushi, no ethnic, don't even THINK about trying to feed a Texan Cal-mex. (too fresh, not enough grease and queso) He travels all over on business and I really wanted to take him some place where he could get a steak that was not a chain he could go to in any other city. Somehow, it was down to HOPR or Harris's and HOPR won out. Okay--I was hopeful, but nervous. I was afraid the kitsch would be too high and the quality would not match the hype. Wrongo. We were a walk-in on a Thursday night. Place was packed. We waited a little over an hour to be seated, but the people-watching at the cozy bar and gawking at what others were about to eat kept us entertained. I've NEVER waited that long for a table anywhere. Glad I did. Once we were seated, it was all as expected. Piping hot bread and butter, then that delish salad. HUGE cuts of meat (we each got the house cut, and I brought home a third of it and most of my baked potato.) The sides are good--yorkshire pudding soaks up that au jus just perfectly; creamed spinach was awesome; nice tater. Our waiter was fantastic! his name is Rick and I'm in love with him. In addition to the excellent food and large portions, we really loved the diverse crowd for people watching from our banquette: suits on expense accounts, family outings, someone's birthday with friends, dates. We got to observe a complete dingbat at a nearby table invite herself to a glass of wine from the neighboring table AND exclaim when introduced to our carver Jesus, "What an interesting NAME! I've never heard that name before. What nationality is that?" That was worth the price of admission right there. I got nothin' bad to say about HOPR. I have *heard* that if you order the hugest cut and finish it, they give you another one to go. I have *heard* that if you get a smaller cut and want more meat, they'll oblige. All I know is that place is awesome. (If you're a vegetarian or a vegan, don't you dare go here unless you have a thick skin and just ate a large meal yourself.)</review>

	<review>I can't help writing review about this place noticing bad reviews.  Can understand meat and family atmosphere don't do it for some girls.  (Why some would order anything other than prime rib here?) Yeah, this is not the best prime rib place; but it has pretty good taste for its value.  And the sides are not as good, but I just save those room for seconds. So as you can see this is a place for meat lovers and they can tone down the atmosphere.  So someone would confuse this as a "date dinner" spot; it's more like "I'm hungry for beef and I'd arrange with my buddies to pig out" spot.   Guys equivalency to girls "spa".</review>

	<review>I first went here 2 yrs ago. Quickly loved it! The main thing I am not a fan of is their salad. Everyone else seems to like it, but not me. IDK. Other than their salad, everything is great! The interior/furniture is nice. My 2nd time going there, my party had reservations at 8 and they did not seat us until like almost 30mins later! Very unhappy about that. Hello, that's why reservations are made ppl! But, I will still be glad to go back lol.</review>

	<review>Imagine stepping in here and experiencing life in the 80s...that exactly how it felt in here. The place gives a old fashion meat dinner type of feel once you step in. Food: Known for it's primerib....there's really no options here...you eat primerib or you go down the street to Ruth's Chris. Please keep in mind I was plastered from the alcohol consumed during the 2 hour wait for a table. The primerib was soft and juicy but not worth the hype. The sides were mediocre..in particular the salad that was served. Service: Pretty good service. Nothing in particular stands out though. Environment: Loud....busy....not how I pictured it. Price: Bit pricey for what it is to me. Food: 3   Service: 4 Environment: 3 Price: 2</review>

	<review>My boyfriend and I made a reservation for this place before we went to watch Wicked at the Orpheum theater and had a very pleasant experience! It was my first time here and I was actually pretty surprised by the dim lighting but it didn't bother me much because I felt like it gave us more privacy in a pretty packed venue. Our reservation was made on a Sunday evening and I was also surprised to see so many people there. It seemed to me that the restaurant was divided into many smaller sized rooms and each room had a station where the chef would cut the Prime Rib off of a huge chunk of meat accordingly to your order. The menu wasn't big or extravagant at all, it just had all the essential cuts of meats and a few side-dishes to compliment your meal. I had the City cut, which was definitely enough for me (and I'd like to say that I can EAT) because we were given a TON of salad and sour-dough prior to the meal... and silly me, I was to hungry to wait for my main dish I ended up finishing almost all of my beet salad first.. haha I had the creamed corn and mashed potatoes as my sides and my boyfriend and I also split an order of the Yorkshire pudding. The Yorkshire pudding basically tasted like corn bread with the texture of a thin but fluffy pancake if that makes any sense. Our waiter was very polite, one of the best service I've received at any restaurant! I'd definitely recommend this place for all you meat lovers looking for a romantic dinner :)</review>

	<review>Best Prime Rib we have EVER had! We try and eat here at least once or twice a year. Wow, wonderful, juicy, flavorful beef, prepared and sliced right there in the room w/ you!!! Sounds weird but we absolutely love the salad and crave it regularly. And the yorkshire pudding and creamed spinach is excellent! Great cocktails which do come in handy for a long wait to be seated(even w/ resv's). You must make reservations or risk waiting and hour or more(reservations must be 6 or more people, boo). A very large restaurant, but seating is always tight and the place is ALWAYS packed wall to wall (i'm surprised to see this only scored 4 stars on yelp). Generous portions of everything(drinks and food), so bring your stretchy pants. For the most part this is a dressy place, but come on it's the Bay Area, people wear what they want. Be prepared for valet parking unless you get lucky...it's SF.</review>

	<review>OMG, I can't believe I've never Yelped HOPR! Then again, I think it's been about 7 years since I've been there... Goodness Gracious, that's way too long!  Anyways, went back for dinner on my birthday end of March and what a dining experience. It was definitely Heavenly. I'm with Brian Boitano on this one!  He said on the Food Network Show, "Best Thing I ever Ate" as HOPR!  I'm so with him on that! I love the salad and I ordered the city cut (I believe that's the smallest cut) and it was just the perfect size for me.  Definitely go with the creamed spinach!  Our server was so on it. The bread was also really good.  Definitely one of my favorite restaurants.</review>

	<review>1 star? what the heck? Here is why: I got food poisoning from the super raw beef. I ate here sometime in November and couldn't really write about it since it gave me such bad memories. I got the regular cut in medium rare. Tell me if I'm wrong to pick at the bone? I mean you can do that with medium rare t-bones right? I think as a restaurant, they should be held responsible for meat that is entirely fully cooked and safe to eat even if it is medium rare. Anyhow, I realize I'm pretty biased because I got sick. If I didn't get sick from the food I would give them 3.5 stars. Here's what it feels like to get food poisoning if you've never experienced it before.... a day later you start to feel ill and weak. You get a slight fever and just out of breath all the time. There's no cold nor sore throat but you feel SICK. And you feel like throwing up all the time which I did for a whole day every hour for like 20 times round the clock. What can I say? I got really unlucky. =(</review>

	<review>Don't go here.  The prime rib isn't succulent.  It's tiny, dry, and cold!  The place is in the dumps.  It smells like rotten fish and bleu cheese.  The bathroom stinks to high heaven, with toilet paper all over the place.  Poor service - can I get a napkin anytime soon?  The sides are small, you would think at these extravagant prices, they would use fresh ingredients.   The cream of corn and cream of spinach BITES.  The wait staff sucks.   The salad is not fresh and it has no taste to it.  The dressing is nothing special.  Plus, no one even comes over to crack pepper on it. Who would want to dine here??? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Btw, this is an attempt to curb first timers, faux restaurateurs, and last minute stragglers.  It's so hard to get reservations these days!  Shhhh!   Let'em think this place sucks so us real patrons can get more of the free second helping.  I love this place!)</review>

But me, if I'm going to be stuck up against someone's ass &amp; elbows I'd rather have it be on the BART with a flask instead of at a restaurant drinking a stupidly high-priced double. I mean, the food was fine. It was pretty good, even. But it was in no way $40 good, and there is no way I would ever come back.</review>

	<review>Came here on a Friday night with a reservation at 10 PM...I think I must've gotten something wrong because when we arrived, the host said our reservation was at 8 and we had missed it.  Nonetheless, he tried to squeeze us in and we were at a table within 15 minutes.   I should have read the reviews to order my prime rib medium rare or rare, but instead I opted for the medium, which was the single worst mistake of my life.  It was tough, chewy, and made me really regret shelling out $40 for something I could have messed up myself at home.  Luckily, my bf ordered medium, and I had a taste of his.  It was absolutely delicious!!  Juicy, tender, and yummy!!  The yorkshire pudding and baked potato were also nice accompaniments to our meal.   Definitely will not be ordering medium ever again.  Hopefully, I'll be able to give this place a second chance and experience the best prime rib San Francisco has to offer!</review>

	<review>I skipped breakfast today because of my meal last night.  I'm seriously still full.  To me this place was the epitome of "American size"  I love prime rib but haven't had it in 5 years b/c i never saw it on a menu in Okinawa.  Back to the restaurant.  The salad was big, tasty, and the equivalent to an entree to me.  I ordered the English cut which meant it was thinly sliced, I believe it was supposed to be more flavorful.  It was mouth wateringly good.  The cream corn and spinach were ok and the mashed potatoes were scrumptious (sp?)  The service was outstanding as they put up with 11 loud dudes drinking and having a good time.  If you want some good prime rib, hit up HOPR!</review>

	<review>MEAT! Oh, how I love meat! The menu here is small, but with good reason...their specialty is prime rib and prime rib is what you get! The only difference in the orders are the portion size and thickness of the cut. The meat is done well...not well-done, done well. No complaints about the meat. The sides though, are on the heavy side. I would've preferred some lighter options since the main course is so heavy itself. The sides weren't that great either..all things creamed. Eh. The service was great. I just love it when servers toss my salad!</review>

	<review>[Featured:  Best Thing I Ever Ate (Food Network); Anthony Bourdain No Reservations (Travel Channel) at http://www.youtube.com/w…. Good decor, good ambiance, good service...and most importantly, good prime rib.  I know a million people will disagree with me, but I think the steak here is better than Harris, the overall dining experience as well.  I've also been to other steakhouses in Vegas and Mortons in L.A. (which is probably not that much different from SF Mortons), and I think HOPR has way better prime rib than they do.  They slow roast the prime rib in a way that keeps it juicy and tender.  The sides are unbelievable.  They have this creamed spinach and mashed potatoes that are out of this world...perfect with the King Henry cut.  If you don't get full from your order, they'll give you an extra slice...which probably wont be necessary.</review>

	<review>First, I want to note that this is more of a social environment than a romantic dinner. I don't know why, but I expected somewhat of a nice sit down place, with real chefs...what I found was a cramped area with a lot of noise and carts everywhere. What were inside these carts? 4 huge blocks of prime rib, with corn in one bucket and creamed spinach in another. I looked at the menu and realized that they literally ONLY serve prime rib, which I was a bit shocked to find. But it's okay, because I would have order prime rib anyway. It comes with a house salad and your choice or mashed potato with gravy or a baked potato and also your choice of corn or creamed spinach all for about $38 (pretty cheap). Overall, I would say that this whole meal tasted like buffet food. You know how you go to a buffet and the meat is already cooked and just sitting there being warmed. Then they slice it for you when you're ready? That was the case here. All the food is already made - the prime rib, the corn, the spinach, the mashed potatoes... Anyway, the salad was decent, although the homemade cherry vinaigrette was a little too sour. The sourdough bread is ordered and dropped off from Boudin every morning. The prime rib was decent. It was not hot, obviously because it is kept on a moving cart with warmers underneath. It was, however, juicy and tender, but also chewy and did I mention, WARM? The corn was absolutely disgusting. It was mushy from sitting in a warmer for a long period of time, same goes for the mashed potatoes. Our server demolished my baked potato and piled it high with bacon and sour cream. I didn't mind the overload of bacon and sour cream, but I was very unhappy that he did not put ANY butter in it. Oh, and they don't have cheese. I was so disgusted with the food here that I didn't even bother getting dessert. And my shirley temple did not have cherries. I was not impressed by the service one bit. I wish I had another server because ours was just annoyingly loud and obnoxious. I knew he was trying to be nice, but he was so pushy. He brought another round of drinks for a table next to ours and practically forced them into buying them since he already brought them out. And no, they weren't even 1/4 done with the drinks they already had! When we were finished with our prime ribs, he asked if we wanted another piece. When we declined, he insisted, just another small slice. During the entire dinner, he did not even once ask us how things were going. He was so busy with the 4 tables he had, even though we were all clumped together that he created this rushed environment. Never again, would I come back to this place. I would not recommend spending $40 here when you can get the same quality of food with even more variety at an American buffet.</review>

	<review>Was here over a week ago. Although the prime rib was good, it was nothing extraordinary. The sides were okay too. I think Lawry's in Beverly Hills is actually better and has better sides too. At least when I tried the creamed corn and Lawry's, I wanted to learn the recipe. But I didn't have the effect here. The spinning salad bowl was fun to watch, but only for the first time. What I do like here is they offer you a second serving of prime rib if you have the House of Prime Rib cut or above. Also, if you are celebrating an event here, let's say a birthday or anniversary, they will bring out ice cream for that person. I don't know if it's a normal thing (seems like it is though), but they took a picture of me and my boyfriend after they brought out the ice cream. Gave us a free print of it and told us where we can go online to download a digital copy of it.</review>

	<review>This is one of the best steakhouses in San Francisco. I normally think of House of Prime Rib when I think of a good cut of meat. The restaurant brings you back a few centuries because of the house looking decor but the best part of the place is the food. Super juicy and moist steak with perfect marbling and amazing flavor. The house salad here is amazing and the sides are very good as well. If you are a big eater they provide seconds and thirds. It is kind of pricy but defiantly worth it if you want a good cut of prime rib.</review>

	<review>This is the place for Prime Rib in San Francisco. I went here after seeing a promotion Amex was running where they asked all the top chefs in the city where they went to dine. For steak/prime rib, they all said the House of Prime Rib. Now I know why. This place is simple and easy because you only have a couple choices: how big a cut of prime rib do you want, mashed or baked potatoes, and beverage. The prime rib is served directly from the wheeled carving station to your plate. The cuts are tender, juicy, a flavorful. A superb steak. The sides are also quite nice. My only complaint about HPR is that it can be quite difficult to get seated, especially on a weekend. I highly recommend calling 1+ weeks in advance to make your reservation, especially if you have a large party or want to eat at a busy hour. Tip: you can ask for seconds on your prime rib. They'll give you a smaller slice for free.</review>

	<review>Come in for some decent meat and a little bit of tableside "show" if you must, but don't expect a life-changing experience. We had a 5:30pm reservation on a Sunday, which was a good thing, because when we came in the restaurant was almost full and there was a long line at the bar.  We were seated promptly, and the hosts were friendly enough. The bread came quickly, and the salad followed a few minutes later.  They make a big show about spinning the salad at your table-side.  I think this is intended to wow diners, but it just didn't dazzle me because, well, how hard is it to spin a salad?  The salad itself was alright, but nothing to go gaga over. I ordered the City cut, and the hubby ordered the King Henry VIII cut.  I ordered mine medium rare and he ordered his medium, but they both came out looking the same.  Oh, well.  The King Henry cut had a bit more fat in it, so it had a bit more flavor than my City cut.  But they were both decently-sized, and I wasn't able to finish my own piece.  The horseradish cream that came with the meat gave it a really nice kick and added to the flavor.  All in all, the meat was good, I enjoyed it but it wasn't anything I'd really get all excited about.  The sides, except for the yummy cornbread, were all quite forgettable. We had a booth at the back room, beside a meat cart.  We were seated next to an elderly Asian couple, and across from them were a couple of guys in business suits.  Across from us were a couple who, from their conversation, sounded like they were tourists.  Yes, you can hear almost all the conversations at the tables near you, even if you don't want to. The service wasn't that great - for some reason our waiter spoke very deferentially to the elderly Asian couple (as he should), but was always in a slight rush and even had bit of haughtiness with us.  I don't know if he just thought that since we were a young couple, he could get away with acting the way he did.  In any case, that showed sub-par training and bad form, especially since we could tell the difference in service, as we were seated so close to the other people! I realize that this restaurant has a lot of fans, but for me it just wasn't anything special.  If you are a meat-lover and want to try eating at an SF institution, by all means, try HOPR.  But as for me, the restaurant fell short of its hype, and was sorely missing that special "something" that will make me want to come back.  So, no, I won't be back, and will not be recommending this restaurant to my friends.</review>

	<review>If I want prime rib, "House of Prime Rib" seems like a no-brainer to me. The choices on the menu is limited, but who cares? It's not like you would come eat everyday. You come when you crave for the Prime Rib. Besides the primb rib, I also like all the other food that they serve with the meat: the salad, the spinach, etc. Simply good quality without a huge price tag. The food and service is consistent. So, you know you will never get disappointed.</review>

	<review>Yes, I have to wake up in the middle of the night after HofPR because I get so dehydrated (the secret must be to infuse with MSG?). Yes, it truly is as delicious as everyone claims. Yes, the staff is friendly and prompt. Yes, I love the beets in the salad (I typically hate beets). No, you can't book the place out for a party of 500 (we're desperate, and considering anything for our wedding--great suggestion though Carol L and Brent P).</review>

	<review>This is the only place to go if you are in the mood for prime rib.  This restaurant has been here for ever.  That says a lot for any restaurant to survive in this city.  My father took me here when I was less than 10 years old and a prime rib dinner was $6.00 according to my father.  Whoa, I am dating myself. I brought him here for a pre father's day dinner.  Anyway, the menu has not changed, (ha ha) meaning the salad, spinach and mashed potatoes, etc. all tastes the same.  Why change a good thing.   Most restaurants usually cook their meat rare and then put them back into the oven to give the customer a medium or well done cut.  Guess what, when that happens, it is usually comes out well done not medium.  Their food is always consistent and if you happen to want another slice, they will give you a another complimentary slice.  It has always been that way in case someone feels they haven't had enough.  In case you haven't notice, there is an elderly man who checks to see if everything is fine and talks to the customer.  My father remembers him when he was a waiter there and now reminds me of a good will ambassador.  He is so sweet. This place is an original.</review>

	<review>Like everyone else has said, the food was pretty good.  They're getting only 3 stars from me because of the service. I brought my parents and my nephew here a few weeks ago.  I had made reservations close to 2 weeks in advance.  We checked in a few minutes before our reservations and was told that we'll be seated shortly. Wow... that was a lie.   We stood there, and waited close to 45 minutes before the table was ready.  During the wait, no one came by to take our drink orders, nor did anyone come by to reassure us that they know we're still waiting. I don't even know why I bother with the reservations.  The only reason we got seated was because I got fed up and told them I'm still standing there, 45 minutes after my reservation time. The food saved their review rating.  Otherwise, they would definitely get a lower rating from me.</review>

	<review>Came here for a birthday dinner with a group of 8. First of all, there is no parking around the restaurant, so we were forced to use their $8 valet. Then they wouldn't seat us until our entire party was present. Ok, that's reasonable. The 8 of us were squeezed in the waiting area, but the hostess, for some odd reason, was very skeptical that our entire party was present because she couldn't "see" all of us. Seriously? The tossed salad with Thousand Island dressing was the best thing of the night. It was fresh with just enough dressing. For my entree, I ordered the English cut (medium) with mashed potatoes and creamed corn. The mashed potatoes came with gravy but was a bit bland. The creamed corn tasted like it came out of a can, and the Yorkshire pudding had no taste at all. The prime rib was a bit too chewy for my taste. There were two slices of meat since it was thinly cut. It was huge so I had to box it. For dessert, I ordered the Double Rainbow ice cream, but the ice cream had freezer burn and was quite icy. Yuck! The waiter was very nice and provided excellent service. The atmosphere and decor of the restaurant was warm and inviting, a perfect place to chat and catch up. There were fireplaces around the restaurant, which gave it a homely feeling. Since I'm not a fan of steak, I probably wouldn't come back for their prime rib but maybe try their fresh fish of the day.</review>

	<review>They bring a lot of food. I think i had the House of Prime Rib Cut and with that i got- salad, corn bread, regular bread &amp; butter, baked potatoe, yorkshire pudding, and corn in place of creamed spinach, which had bacon and I don't eat pork. I loved the corn bread and the creamed corn but the meat wasn't flavorful at all. I'll go again though and give it another try. Btw, really busy for a Tuesday night. Reservation for 9 pm and went early to see if we can be seated and nope, nothing.</review>

	<review>This place makes me laugh!  The truth of the matter is that the prime rib is pretty good.  Plus when you go, you know what you are going to get b/c the menu is limited.  Mash taters and greens, holllller!  I took a good friend, who is a complete meat eater, out for his bday and we had a nice time.  The decor is a bit odd, and the huge silver rolling servers are a  bit like roaving spaceships, but it's all quite entertaining! The food is alright too, but keep in mind you are going for the prime rib.</review>

	<review>Classy place, put on a nice dress shirt, and some slacks -call in to reserve a table. With that said, the House of Prime Rib is truly a gem of san francisco eats, and I had a 5 star experience. Just as I like it, the menu is quite simple -there are only 4 kinds of cuts available. There is the $37 English cut (2 thin slices), $39 kings cut (bone-in thicker slice), $37 regular cut, and a kid's dinner. I came here with my girlfriend's family and it was a fantastic experience. We had reservations at 9, but got the table at around 9:30; it wasnt much of a problem since we had speedy wine service at the waiting area (which was both spacious and nice). The bottle of wine was around $65, but it was delicious and perfect with steaks. Well.. after sippin on some pinot noir and gettin a lil wooohoo, we were seated in the middle hearth of the restaurant. Imagine a blizzard outside.. the wind is chafing your skin, the snow is freezing you to the core, the clothes you are wearing are doing nothing to keep you warm.. imagine that. It was THAT cold outside san francisco.. but the warmth of the House of Prime Rib kept my spirits high, immunity strong, and warm enough to take off my jacket. Kudos. When we were seated, we were immediately greeted by a courteous waitress and given two large Sourdoughs. The bread was really good, but don't fill up. After I placed my order for the King's Cut, I sliced the bread, served it, and waited anxiously for my steak to come. The salad was what came next. It was a good salad -fresh, plentiful, and tasty. I ate about half before relinquishing it to the waitress. My steak eventually came 10 minutes after my salad. As side dishes I had mash potatoes and the cream of spinach. My steak was perfect. IT WAS GOOD. Its not often that I enjoy steak at restaurants, but House of Prime Rib is the exception (that and Cattlemen). You see, I come from a family of steak-eaters.. steak is a staple item to our diets and thus are constantly replenished in my refrigerator. we eat so much steak that .. there was a time in my life when I didn't even want steak anymore.. rather have some simple foreman-grill chicken. har har. But being such a big steak-eater has its own perks; I can easily tell the quality of the beef, and HOPR got some high quality steaks. The steaks are marbelized, and thus also very tasty. Usually, I only have this TYPE of quality steak on big holidays like Thanksgiving or Christmas.. so to my surprise, I was very happy about the good steak and warm environment. Aside from the steak, the mash potatoes were also good, but nothing extraordinary. The spinach was.. okay, but too buttery for me. Other than that, HOPR gave me a 5 star experience. After I was done with my food, I was offered a second serving of the King's cut.. but declined because I was already.. quite satisfied. -wifive-</review>

	<review>Meat meat meat. I love meat - especially nice and bloody. Mmmm. Ok, so maybe not hit me over the head bloody, but I do like prime rib on the rare side. I think that's how it's supposed to be? Add a ton of horseradish to HOPR's chunk o' juicy, tender beef and you've got a happy girl. However, I do have to add that I'd like to minus 1/8 of a star for a major pet peeve I have about HOPR. They totally discriminate against little people! Ok, so I'm definitely not little (atleast sideways), but I tend to be a lot smaller than my dinner dates there. Almost always, I am served a significantly smaller portion than the bigger, more deserving of a big slice of meat dinner partner of mine. I called it last time and yup, it happened. Even if you order the exact same thing. Maybe it's good portion control for me, but it is a bit irritating. If you're small, but know how to speak up, I'd definitely recommend this place.</review>

	<review>Great place to take out of towner's who are meat and potatoes kinda people.  The prime rib was great, but if you aren't a prime rib eater then not the place for you.  The atmosphere was very old school and nice and cozy, so cozy, that after a few glasses of cab I was so hot!  I wouldn't go here for a night out., but this is entertaining for big groups and people visiting.</review>

	<review>Been here a couple times.  Prime rib did not taste the same as the first time.  So the taste of the food is not consistent.  But for the romantic and sophisticated ambience, meal, crowd and restaurant employees, the price is ok.  Don't think it's worth the money though. I recommend that that you always have a glass of red wine with the meat.  You can't go wrong and it's helps to digest hearty meals.   I said A glass...not the entire bottle.</review>

	<review>my least favorite song in the whole wide world is the happy birthday song.  i dread singing it every time someone is one year older. i almost don't like going out for birthdays because of the song. but my boyfriend turned 29 yesterday and we decided to visit the famous HPR for some delicious prime rib. unfortunately, it was everyone else's birthday that day too. every 10 minutes they were singing happy birthday to another table and brining out a free ice cream with a candle. i wonder if people just say it's their birthday to get something free after spending 37 bucks on the henry viii. it was funny because last time we went to HPR, it seem like a more nose sniffing crowed. last night was odd because as soon as we walked in, we were welcome to the view of some guy with pants sagging down to his knees making out with an asian girl wearing bootie shorts and a hoodie. he was wearing a fancy jacket though, so i guess it made it okay. that was not all, i saw a handful of hipsters, and it made me feel more like home. the meal was delicious. perfectly aged 21 days prime rib cuts with cream of spinach and a baked or mashed potato. plus, a salad with beets with a dressing that no one can top. "We do one thing, and we do it exceptionally well. We are often imitated, but never duplicated." -HPR this place makes me feel sorry for vegetarians.</review>

I come here every year for my bday, and once again this place was awesome! although i had to wait for a while due to reservation change, I had a wonderful time! the bar tender was very nice (gave me free drink) even introduced me to the owner of the place who was such a sweetheart! Got my free desert, the food was amazing as usual and i even got to take my sides home (normally you aren't able to). all in all i've always had a great experience here with the food as well as customer service. this is my 7th year coming for my bday and i have to say probably many more to come:)</review>

	<review>Yummm. Service was perfect. Ordered a Lemon drop (with Grey Goose) at the bar - delicious! Loved the salad and all the sides the prime rib came with (I love sides). Even though my friend and I were visibly younger than most of the clientele at this place, our server was super nice and courteous. I wasn't able to finish my meal, but my friend did, and our server offered him an extra slice of the prime rib... Definitely would come here again.</review>

	<review>Do you have trouble making decisions?  When you go out to a restaurant, especially a steak place, are you boggled by all of the different cuts and sides?  Do you enjoy a fine meal put together in an old-school way with a bit of flair? House of Prime Rib is the establishment it is because it just seems to do it all right.  The menu is short, painfully short.  You are basically limited to a selection of how think of a cut you want (it is all prime rib, no strips, fillets, or ribeyes), whether you want your potato baked or mashed, and whether you want creamed spinach or corn.  Besides that, the menu is pretty much set for you. The waiter puts the salad together at your table, spinning and dressing it in front of you.  Same goes for the baked potato.  A 'carver' with a very art deco looking cart (all polished steal, like something out of Savory circa 1928) comes and cuts your slice of heaven off right in front of you.  It is all tender, juicy, and delicious. Price per person is reasonable, considering the fact that everything is included.  Cuts range from $34 to $40, but all sides are included (including the delicious Yorkshire pudding!).  The service was top notch, the owner, an older man in a suit with an American flag tie and pin (my guess is he is a proud Italian immigrant) was stopping by each table to make sure we were enjoying our meal. If you like dead cow, come here.  Plain and simple.</review>

	<review>Holy flipping Prime Rib! We did not have reservations so it took ~an hour to be seated, but they have a nice bar area where we sat and ordered drinks.  I had the Lemon drop which was basically sugar and alcohol.  A friend raved about his Manhattan.   Meat: Most of us had the House of Prime Rib Cut which they describe as a hearty portion of juicy, tender beef.  It was a indeed a hunk of juicy meat.  I could have not handled seconds if I would have tried. Sides: Baked Potato- It was strange, the same face of amazement came over every ones face as he made our potato's with all the fixings. Creamy Spinach: Don't know how much spinach was actually in there, but the thought of eating spinach somehow made me feel better. Yorkshire pudding:  Not a fan. I tried to soak up the juice with it, but left most of it on the plate. Salad: Like everyone else I had no idea what the dressing was, but I loved the show they put on while making the salad. I would have gobbled it all down if I didn't have 1000's calories coming within a few minutes.   Super Tasty, super fatty, super delicious, but super expensive for a poor little grad student.</review>

Our reservation was @ 8:30, we did not get seated until 10:00 pm! Needless to say we were very disappointed as well as starving to death.. staff did not seem to concerened, bought a couple rounds of drinks and said sorry.. we won't be back.. and they forgot his birthday.. i guess that is what happens when you do 500 covers a night.. they just don't care!! oh, and our first table was in the dungeon and so loud i couldn't even hear my husband.. asked to move, that took another  twenty minutes.. place was so packed it was ridiculous.. never again!!</review>

	<review>basically: awesome. Fellow Yelpers recommended this place for a nice dinner with a close friend... it didn't disappoint the martinis come with their shaker(that easily has another full drink in it... thusly giving you 2 drinks for 7-9 bucks) the salad is huge, the cuts of meat are amazing... granted, its a little pricey for an everyday dinner,but totally worth it for a special night =-). they lose 1 star for how damn loud it is. not their fault, but i could barely hear myself think in this place at times. Quiet and romantic? no. Sit side by side in huge comfy booth drinking wonderfully strong(and yummy) drinks and eating yummy food? win. Its definitely a place i'll be returning to, if only for more tiramisu.</review>

	<review>Came here for dinner around 6 pm, and boy was it packed!! We were told the wait would be 30- 40 mins, so we decided to get some drinks at the bar while waiting. Let me add that this would be our first meal of the day-- horrible idea, as we ended up drinking a little bit too much wine, and consuming a few bottles of those crackers while waiting.   Anyways, we basically ended up waiting 1 hr. and 30 minutes. We were seated around 7:30-7:40. (No Exaggeration.)  It would have been nice if we had been quoted an accurate time from the host. Once seated, we ordered our food- I had the English Cut and he had the King Henry Cut. The food took a while to come out, but there are little sides here and there that come out to distract you from the wait.-- bread, salads.. etc. Once the food came out, I was already partially full. I enjoyed the creamed corn and Yorkshire pudding with my Medium-Rare meat. The prime rib was juicy, and was delicious. Next time, I'll pass up on the smaller items and save my appetite for the delicious prime rib!! I usually am the type to order dessert but I had absolutely no room. I want to come back and try the desserts!! Overall, classy place with excellent food and service. I'll be back, but hopefully I'll have a better experience with the wait-time. =X</review>

	<review>I have to admit, I've been dreaming of this place ever since Anthony Bourdain made his way there. And good god their prime rib is delicious! I recently went here for a friend's birthday dinner and it was incredible. Both the food and the service lived up to my very high expectations. My mouth begins to water just thinking of their aus jus covered prime rib. They are priced decently for what you get, although I do believe this place will remain under the "special occasion" category for my budget. I ordered the English Cut which was the perfect portion for me, and the creamed spinach &amp; mashed potatoes were fantastic. Didn't order the baked potato but it was definitely one of most loaded potatoes I've ever seen. Now all I've gotta is come up with more of those so-called special occasions so can have another evening of the legendary prime rib once again!</review>

	<review>Even though I no longer live in California, the House of Prime Rib will always have a special place in my heart. The experience for me starts with the reservation process; the staff who handles these requests are incredibly courteous and professional. They all understand the policies and can handle your individual situations with efficiency and competence. However, do know that this place fills up quickly so make your reservations at least three or four days in advance. If you arrive with or without a reservation and there is a waiting time, it is spent in a designated lounge with a full bar and complementary light snacks. Once seated, the menu is very easy to navigate; pick a cut of the prime rib, pick between the creamed corn or creamed spinach, pick between the mashed or baked potatoes, and wait to be satisfied. The a la carte option is different and I've never gotten it, so I wouldn't know much about it. One of my favorite parts of this experience is the salad. The salad has very fresh ingredients and your server will bring a large salad bowl to your table and toss it in front of you. The dressing that they use is a house recipe and that combined with the chopped beets and all the other ingredients make for the BEST TOSSED SALAD I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. Honestly, I usually hate beets, but I can't get enough of it in this case. The meat is pretty good quality; I get the medium rare and I've never been disappointed. Your plate will come with your sides and also a Yorkshire pudding (light and fluffy) and a corn bread. The best part of HOPR is that they will never let you leave hungry (or even less than bloated). If you order any cut except for the smallest one, you'll be allowed to get seconds of any of the sides AND of the meat itself. I can't tell you how happy I get when that second plate comes with a second (albeit smaller) cut of prime rib and my favorite sides. If you couldn't decide between the sides in the beginning, you're in luck because you can always get the one you didn't choose as a second portion. It's an amazing concept and it's definitely worth the money. Lastly the wine selection is very decent; they have people who can recommend a good wine for your buck to go well with the meal. I've never had the desserts here because, well, I've never been physically able to. Definitely a must-visit if you're a visitor to the San Francisco Bay Area.</review>

	<review>Like everyone else, I'd heard a lot of great things about House of Prime Rib. Finally got the chance to check it out last weekend. The service at the bar lounge area is spotty. It took some time for the waitress to make her round towards our table. The little jars of mixed snacks are refilled, whatever is not eaten ends up in someone else's hands. Total turnoff. It took a hour for a walk-in table on a Friday night so be prepared to wait. I had a good time here because of my company. Otherwise, the food is definitely overrated, by a long shot. The King cut was good, but I would definitely go elsewhere the next time I look for prime rib. Yes, the yorkshire pudding and sides were great, but the salad flourish was waaaaay too touristy feeling. I just thought, "hmmm, seems like a Benihana of meat move." We did have a bottle of the Jordan cab and it was divine! Keep expectations realistic and somewhat low before you walk into this place.</review>

	<review>If you don't live in SF and generally eat at Red Lobster or Olive Garden, this will be an experience in fine dining, complete with cloth napkins, multiple forks and other *fancy* things. If, however, you live in a city and eat at good restaurants regularly, you will undoubtedly be disappointed by this amatuer, cheesy, over-hyped dispenser of low-quality food. The choices are slim and the food is poorly prepared. The so-called creme of spinach did not appear, to me, to have either. The *famous* prime rib was served at essentially room temperature and was ok but certainly not a fine piece of meat. The topper for me was the oversized, inelegant salad, with its iceberg lettuce and beets.  As if the watered down Thousand Island (yes, I said Thousand Island) dressing was not bad enough, our waitress basically insisted that she "season" it with some dry flakes in a plastic dispenser, which we later noticed contained MSG.   For those of you travelling over a bridge to SF, you will undoubtedly protest that they serve you a special salad fork, a sign of true class.  If you feel that way, this is exactly the place for you. If you have ever eaten at a nice establishment, the only reasons to go to this place are:  (i) you enjoy laughing at the bridge and tunnel crowd getting dressed up for a big night on the town; (ii) you love watery Thousand Island dressing and can't seem to find it at your local Safeway; (iii) you want to see how the other half gets fooled by simple signatures of "Fancy Food" even though the food actually sucks. Another thing:  nearly everyone in the room we were in was having a birthday!  How FUN!  The waiters sing and everyone is sooo festive.  Also, we noticed that nearly every table brought a camera and really wanted to record for posterity their fancy night out. If you want steak, go to Harris'.  If you want a fancy night out to impress your girlfriend or mistress from Pinole (but don't have any idea what a good restauarant is like), then BINGO this is the place for you and all your friends.</review>

	<review>Made reservations for 10pm - that was the earliest we could get when we called in Sat afternoon.  We didn't get seated until 1030ish, but I still gave it 4 stars - for good reason! Asked about closing time - the waitress stated that they basically continue to serve until they either run out of meat or customers.  Awesome philosophy! The restaurant ambiance is pretty swell. Even though the wait could be long, once you're seated, your food comes out FAST! Within the first 5 mins of being seated, we were given bread (toasty sourdough that was yum).  Next, they brought out the salad that they toss right in front of your table.  This was when I decided that yes, I did like beets. After the salad was brought out, less than 5 mins later our entree came.  I am not the biggest red beef kind of gal, but the prime rib was DOPE.  I really liked the sides too - Yorkshire pudding (who couldn't love toasted crispy goodness?), creamed spinach (the best I've had) and a loaded baked potato w/sour cream, chives and bacon (bacon galore!).   Overall, I was very satisfied and would definitely come back, even with the weird bartender that works there.</review>

	<review>I love love love this place!!  It's such an unpretentious and homey steakhouse.  You can come here dressed up or for a casual meal.  If you take a look at the plates, you will know this isn't some shee shee place but really just a place for people to enjoy the food.   I got the City Cut (the smallest one; about 5-6 oz.) and like all the other prime rib dishes, it came with a huge house salad, your choice of mashed potatoes or a baked poato, Yorkshire pudding, and your choice of either creamed spinach or creamed corn.  The Yorkshire pudding really surprised me because I was expecting American pudding.  Turns out this is like a thin slice of bread cooked from batter, almost like a pancake.  It tastes good eaten with the meat and the sauce.  I requested the meat to be cooked medium-rare and it was perfect.  Tender, fatty, and flavorful all throughout. Service is excellent.  Our server was timely with everything and met all our needs. In the beginning, they give you so much bread and salad that it's hard to not to get full before the meat comes.  Luckily, you can just pack it up to go and eat it for breakfast.  That's what I did and it was delicious!</review>

	<review>Meh, indeed. I love red meat. I do NOT love the House of Prime Rib. For $35 I got a plate of corn-fed, feedlot cow. Sad times. Three thin slices, very heavily salted, and I asked for it rare, but it was definitely (and unfortunately) medium-well. My friend asked for his thick-cut slice medium but when it arrived it was medium-rare. The accompanying food was all salty and unexciting, though the cornbread was delicious! The Manhattans were also delicious and very generously sized. Service was great! Of course we were there for about three hours total, waiting for our table and drinking aforementioned Manhattans and eating carby stuff. I definitely think people come here because it's an instutution and because of the setting, not because of the food. I just wanted to go home and get a steak from a cow that had roamed around eating grass and didn't arrive here via a boat or cross-country trailer, and cook it RARE with a little black pepper... yum.</review>

	<review>My family took my little brother out to the House of Prime Rib for his birthday. I've been here before for other events (graduations, birthdays). It's kind of pricey, so we only go here for sspecial occasions. Their prime rib is heavenly. You get rich creamed spinach (with bacon bits and cream) or creamed corn, mashed potatoes, a big plate salad, loaves of fresh sourdough bread with butter, prime rib, and yorkshire pudding. It's a set menu, which is fine by me because everything that comes with your meal is fantastic. They truly do one thing and do it well. You cut yourself a slice of juicy prime rib, dip it in the au jus. then, you take a little horseradish butter (they give you a choice of mild or medium, which are both pretty mild in my opinion) and spread it over the top before putting the beautiful, juicy piece of heaven in your mouth. The whole piece literally melts in your mouth. Soooo good.   The King Henry VIII cut is the top of the line cut of prime beef. My brother ordered this cut. It was super juicy and delicious. I got the House of Prime Rib cut and it was good but a little less juicy and a little grainier in texture, towards the center by comparison. But it was delicious as well. Now I'm not sure if this is true or not, but I heard that if you eat your whole prime rib plate, they will give you seconds if you request it (after you've had drinks, sourdough bread, and a huge bowl of salad). But I couldn't find out because I was so unbelievably stuffed by the end of the meal. lol The staff are also attentive and cooperative. We asked to move to different location (because we realized that we were surrounded by loud, drunk people). So, they obliged right away. The manager/owner even joined in and helped out. I'll be seeing you again, House of Delicious Food.</review>

Sure it may be a little pricey ($30-40) but when you consider the ever so delicious meal, and the possibility of seconds....come on! This place also has the best service. The staff is so friendly and wonderful, def. a major plus of the restaurant.</review>

	<review>I guess I hyped this place up in my head way too much.  Everyone raved about it to me.  Said I had to go here, and that they could not believe that someone who grew up in SF had not been here.   So I went.  We took a friend from out of town.  And he agreed and confirmed that it wasn't just us, but this was not as amazing as we had expected.   We were actually seated on time, despite what other Yelpers have said, that part worked out for us.  Our server was nice, she got our drinks right away.  We all had the same item, meal, or whatever, there aren't many options for you other than what they are really known for.   The salad came out, and I personally liked it.  I know it was Thousand Island dressing but maybe I'm deprived and never have that.  So for that night, I liked the dressing.  My BF and our friend weren't impressed.   The prime rib, yes it was good.  Pretty darn good.  Melt in my mouth, take me to another planet?  No, I won't say that.  But it was good.   The potato?  like Leon said, more an afterthought.  The Yorkshire Pudding was good to soak up the juice, and the creamed spinach and corn, I could do without.   For the meal itself, it was okay.  The sides were not impressive but the prime rib made up for what the sides lacked.  And the fact that it was all you can eat, well that scores points with the BF.   But other things to note, the service was incredibly slow.  It took 25 minutes to get our salads, and then 35 minutes to get our sides and meat.  I know they were busy but it seemed like our poor server had every table in the room.  Plus with a menu that is the same for pretty much everyone (aside from the cut of meat they want), you would think the food would be easy to put out in a timely manner.   All in all, we finally went there.  So now we know.  And though the three of us agreed it didn't live up to they hype, we did agree that the specialty, the prime rib was pretty darn good.</review>

	<review>The infamous House of Prime Rib. The waiter spilled a little of my martini on me when he offered to pour it in the glass for me.  Oops.  Dumbass, she told you the lids don't sit tight on the little shakers you get with your martini. Anywho.  It was all very good.  I wouldn't say "holy shit" good.  I would say, however  "holy shit that's a lot of food".  My stomach was hurting when I left.   Didn't like the salad.  Creamed spinach was ok.  Meat was meaty, juicy, thick - not too much fat.   And well, it's prime rib.  Honestly, I think you have to be a moron to eff-up cooking a good piece of meat.   No morons here, other than the occasional drink spillage (haha).  Ok, I will let it go now... Creme brulee, was kinda bland.   Verdict... if you live in the Bay Area, trying this place once in your lifetime will be enough.  Got friends and relatives from out of town and want to impress them - take them here.</review>

	<review>I've only eaten here once (2 yrs ago?), but I definitely want to go back! For the price you pay, you better expect good food and good service and that's what I got. The wait wasn't too long after I checked in for my reservation. Just hung out around the bar area until my name was called. I don't know if it was another restaurant or not b/c I've eaten at a lot of these types of restaurants, but I think they had some sort of pub mix(?) for you to nibble on while you wait. After being seated, the waiter was very knowledgeable and helpful. Got my food and was most excited about the sides that came with my prime rib! THEY WERE SOOO GOOOD!!!!!! I think I had corn, spinach, and yorkshire pudding! Prime rib was REALLY good too. I ordered mine medium rare mmm juicy! Oh and super cool that they bring a cart over and cut you your order in front of you. And if you were stil hungry, I think you were able to get seconds! AWESOME for people that can eat a crapload of cow haha Oh and someone came by with a camera to ask if you wanted your photo taken, which I think is cool! Really nice ambiance, so I suggest you look nice too haha</review>

	<review>You just cannot beat this place for their prime rib, obviously. I have never been disappointed here -- the food is fantastic, the staff is warm and friendly, and of course you are never going to leave hungry. One of my favorite parts of the meal is the salad that they hand toss at your table. Don't forget to make reservations. This place fills up like you wouldn't believe. If you can snag an early time (like 5:30) you won't wait to sit down. One of the best SF institutions around!</review>

	<review>I think a lot of people have bought into the hype with this place. I only give it 3 stars. The prime rib is definitely tasty, don't get me wrong. But the rest is just so/so. I mean, the salad is a joke (they try to awe you with showmanship by making it in front of you) and the mashed potatoes are only decent (my mom can make better mashed potatos). I think $40 is too much to pay for a piece of fatty prime rib. But, if you want to experience what everyone else (i.e. tourist) is raving about, by all means....check it out.</review>

	<review>Cant believe I lived in San Francisco for so long, but my first time at HOPR was last November. I absolutely love the food, service, and environment. The server was very helpful knowing it was our first time there. The place was packed like usual i guess but the food came out in reasonable time. THE CORN BREAD WAS THE 'ISH! Great prime rib cuts and de-licous sides.</review>

	<review>Dined here with a group of 7 for a birthday dinner celebration. This time around, better company and calmer ambiance. Salad was tossed ever so slightly and not as soggy as I had remembered. I ordered the small cut and explained to the server exactly how I wanted it. She was a phenomenal server with a great personality and attended to my requests even with a larger party with me. Spinach and mashed potatoes were also very tasty and also made for great leftovers the next day. This place is definitely a staple of SF, and great for larger parties.</review>

	<review>Wow, it's so hard to get reservations for this place. I guess the economy is not so tough if you want to eat Prime Rib! That's basically the only thing HoPR serves and if that's what you want, you've come to the right place. I'm actually salivating just thinking about it. Don't be intimidated--get the 16 oz cut. The sides are baked or mashed potatoes, and creamed spinach. A cold salad is served before the main course. Dinner for two (no drinks) including a shared dessert was about $90. They serve what they call Yorkshire Pudding but it's more like a sweet Nan. I've had better. There is also a waiter who comes around with some fresh baked corn bread which is very nice. There are at least three kinds of horseradish and a fresh, warm sourdough placed at the table. Overall, the meal was great and the service was excellent. I don't always eat prime rib, but I would definitely come back here again when I get that craving!</review>

	<review>Great food, great atmosphere! If there is any negative, it's the wait. Even with reservations, sometimes you still have to wait for 15-20 minutes. I want my meat now! This is the best prime rib you can find - juicy, tender, and sliced in front of you in a giant meat trolley. I love getting the English cut, which is thin, and perfect for someone that wants a lot of flavor and juicyness, but not a giant slab of meat. I also love the sides - my favorites are the mashed potatoes, and creamed corn. And of course, the yorkshire pudding and au jus...mmmm. This place has a decidedly old European feel, with plush booths, dim lighting, dark woods, and a bar that is always teeming with drinks and patrons. The hardwood floor is slippery with certain types of heels and flats, be warned! I've almost wiped out a couple times (and no, I was not tipsy). I've been here many times but still love it the same each time. MEAT!</review>

	<review>Old-school blue collar swank at its very very best. I took my trendilicious, yuppified ex-gf and her fine italian Balenciaga handbag to this joint for New Year's Eve last year.  Boy, was she pissed!!!  I did not hear the end of how if I had gotten off my ass earlier, I could have made a ressie at Aqua, Boulevard or Garibaldi's. Well thank God I didn't, because as she sat there stewing, whacked out her mind oggling all the wood paneling, vinyl booths and oily-haired Excelsiorites enjoying their Rum Swizzles, my heart could not but fill with glee at the site of warm french bread, iceberg salad mixed tableside with a sprinkle of tangy, delicious msg, creamed spinach, yorkshire pudding, hot baked potatoes filled to the rim with dollops of pink stuff, and last but by no means least, huge slabs of juicy slow-cooked prime rib rolled out in silver carts. The sensations swirled about as a dream of indescribable pleasure and pain the likes of which I would never experience again....</review>

	<review>Do you like big slabs of tasty ass meat. Well this is the place for you!! In all seriousness, it is a lovely restaurant, totally old school and one of my all time favorite places to go. The prime rib is to die for and once you have had theirs, no one else's even comes close!! You get the prime rib, creamed spinach, your choice of potato, and of course yorkshire pudding. Don't eat all day before you go, because they come around and ask if you would like seconds. Now have you ever heard of a place doing that?? Oh yeah I think sometimes they have fish or something for the non meat eaters on the menu. Don't do it people, get the red meat. It is called the house of prime rib and that is what they do best!</review>

	<review>Minus a small wait upon arrival, (even with a reservation) our experience at the House of Prime Rib on a Wednesday night was very pleasant.  All the staff we encountered was great including an older gentleman who made his way to all the tables making sure the meal was to our liking.   Every part of their fixed specialty menu was delish, from the wine vinaigrette salad dressing, creamed spinach to their expertise prime rib.  I ordered the smallest cut, "The City Cut" and it was more than enough to fill me up!  The assortment of horseradish is fun and so is all the neat ways your waiter serves the food.</review>

	<review>BF brought me here for my birthday so it was not my choice to come here again.  I remember loving the salad before but this time the server poured the entire container of dressing as he spun the bowl and the salad was wet and wilted so I did not enjoy eating soggy salad.  We shared the 20 oz cut and for an extra $7.00 they let you add sides for the extra person.  I thought the mashed taters &amp; gravy, and the creamed spinach were too salty.  The creamed corn however, totally gets a star because it was really tasty!   I got a dish of delicious creamy vanilla ice cream with a lit candle on it and they took our photo.  We got the photo in a nice cardstock frame on our way out.  That was a nice surprise!  I do like this place but they got our reservations mixed up too so make sure you double check the day of!</review>

	<review>One of the best Steak Houses I have ever been to in my life.  The setting was nice.  The host was nice.  The entire staff was so helpful and nice.  THe Prime RIB was oh my god THE BEST!! We started out with a salad that I forgot to ask what dressing was applied, but man it was one of the best tasting salads I have ever had.  Then I ordered the King Henry VIII prime rib cut, medium and was in heavan for about fifteen minutes. It came with a baked potato, corn and bread pudding.  The steak was so warm it was served in a portable heating tray that the CHEF personally brings to your table.  All this food was about $42 a person, which was worth the price!! One of the top three steakhouses I have ever been too!!</review>

	<review>So, last night, I went to the House of Prime Rib again. Last time I went, I waited a really long time and that was a Sunday. This time, on a Friday, I was expecting an even longer waited. Surprisingly, we waited less than five minutes for our table. Again, we were in the good room at a corner table. The food was delicious. I ordered exactly the same items as before. We got to meet the owner, he's really nice, as was the wait staff, who was very patient with my friend whom had a few drinks while I was at work. One downside, it got really hot, so each course, I was wearing one less item. First the time, then the jacket, then;.......Just kidding, that's all I took off. It was my own fault for wearing a boring white shirt, so I won't nix them for turning on the heat in winter. You should go, it is delicious, the staff is great, and the prices are very reasonable.</review>

	<review>Oh my gawd!!!! I loved The House of Prime Rib and this will be our first stop if and when we are back in SF. In fact, we might just eat here every day the next time we are there!!! I really wanted to try this place although the hubby and I didn't hold high hopes after a few other disappointments from the Food Network and from Brian Boitano. However, he was right on with this place. The atmosphere was warm and cozy like an old school steak house. The service we received was superb. I can't remember our waiters name but he was the best server I think I have ever had. Friendly, funny, had terrific recommendations, quick, concise, pretty much everything you could ask for in a server. Now, onto my favorite part: THE FOOD! First and foremost, if you are not a fan of red meat or prime rib, this is not your place. The menu is very small. You basically choose the same meal (unless you order the special which was fish that night) as everyone else, but you get a few options: cut of prime rib you would like, baked or mashed potato, creamed spinach or creamed corn, and you get salad, bread and Yorkshire pudding. Also, you get a trio of horseradish sauces that vary from mild and cream to spicy and pure horseradish. I absolutely loved everything. To start, the bread from what I remember was a fairly good loaf of sourdough (The real San Francisco treat). The salad was one of my favorite parts of the meal. it was honestly unlike any other salad I have ever had: greens with bacon, hard-boiled egg and sliced beets with some kinda signature creamy champaign vinaigrette prepared table side. I'm tellin ya, one of the best salads I have ever had. I still crave it to this day and I went over a month ago. Gonna try to make it at home but fear it will not come out even close. I am not even a fan of beets but the beets and the egg made this salad! Ok Ok, so now that I am done having a foodgasm thinking about this dam salad of all things, I will attempt to describe the awesomeness of the actual meal. The prime rib was tender and flavorful, yet not overpowered by seasoning. This is one place where they let the meat speak for itself. The mashed potatoes were velvety and smooth and the gravy on top was perfectly seasoned and the perfect thickness, the creamed spinach tasted smoky like bacon (how can anyone not like that) so much that the hubby who is not even a fan of spinach really liked it, and the yorkshire pudding was warm and tasty. I liked the yorkshire pudding but am not sure why they call it pudding cause it is more of a pastry. It was great for mopping up the jus and the gravy from the potatoes. Oh so to wrap it up, if you have ever had one of those terrific dining experience and terrific meals where you were so content after and couldn't stop talking about it after, then you know how I felt when we left. I still think about that meal and experience to this day and get giddy. To me, although it was a bit pricier, it was worth every penny. It was terrific and if you are even the slightest bit doubtful of whether you will like it, get that out of your head cause this place is fantastic. I am not even a big prime rib person but I loved every bite and I pray every night that they will build a House of Prime Rib in AZ. Until then, I will simply have to dream...</review>

	<review>This food is pure heaven.  I've enjoyed every single visit.  At $25 a meal, it is a great value, especially compared to other similar establishments in the area.   This is one of the most enjoyable meals I've ever had in a restaurant.  From their mouth watering yorkshire pudding, to their wonderful prime rib selections, not to mention two servings of wonderful horseradish dips, the food is addictive.  Every time I go, I get the same high quality, delicious meal. The establishment has been around since 1949, and has a special feel to it when you enter.  The waitresses perform for you with their iceburg lettuce twirl, and are of the highest quality, even remembering your name when you return. The only complaint is how long you have to book ahead of time to get a reservation on the weekends.  It's hard to get in without a week's notice.</review>

	<review>I've been to "HOPeR" for about 10 years straight and the ambiance hasn't changed one bit.  And amazingly, the food itself is pretty consistent.  I've been to other similar restaurants like Broadway Prime and Lawry's, but for the relative value and taste, HOPR is still the best. The prime rib is, of course, the star.  Just specify how well done you like your meat and it's pretty close.  IMO, the next best thing is the warm bread and butter.  Probably because I arrive to the restaurant starving and it's the first thing on your table.  I don't really care for the beet/iceberg lettuce salad with heavy thousand island dressing.  But it's cool to watch while they make it.  Other sides include creamed spinach, creamed corn, mashed or baked potato.  Not a fan of those things either.  I usually just get a baked potato with a little butter and chives.  Yorkshire pudding is a nice touch but I never touch it. Desserts are simple, not too exotic.  Creme brulee is probably the best thing they have. In my younger days, I would get seconds on the prime rib, but not anymore.   Due to high volume every night, expect to wait a little bit even with reservations.  Also expect service to be a little hurried, but they do aim to please.  Reservations are highly recommended. All in all, if I feel like prime rib, I ALWAYS go here.</review>

	<review>Prime Rib - 4.5 stars Everything else - Service/Ambiance - 3.25 Now you have to want a prime rib, because that is what they have on the menu.  It's some of the *best* prime rib you will eat too.   Simple, so why not join the 5 star herd?   Well, it's everything else that is good but not necessarily outstanding.  Your paying $40 per plate, so was my beet salad good (yes, because I don't even like beets but this one it did).  Was my sour dough round tasty and warm with lots of BUTTER, of course.  Was my CREAM spinach tasty, yep.  Now how about my BACON potato with tons of sour cream, chives, and cheese.   Think about the last time you had something with BACON, BUTTER, CREAM, CHEESE, etc ... did you like it?  Of course, five star - ah no.  Okay, the Prime Rib itself was really, really outstanding. Felt crammed into the restaurant, few too many tables and people - the beef cart couldn't even make it by.  Our booth for four was a bit tight.   Seems like our waiter (while very nice) had a few too many tables.  Poured my own wine and water.  Not super loud but not a fine dinning experience either - think of a classy Outback.     It was nice touch that the lady walked around calling my name for the table.  Harris Steak House has HOPR beat here, no question. Finally, wow the prime rib is awesome but everything else needs a bit more attention for the price.  I know, I know there are tons of happy 5 star HOPR addicts and I am happy for you both.   Probably won't come back soon unless I have to have PRIME RIB!!!!</review>

	<review>I can't deal with turkey--not even for the pilgrims and indians. So bland. So dry. So unappetizing. That's why I was glad to have some friends that felt the same way. Together we came to House of Prime Rib for Thanksgiving, continuing my wonderful turkey-free holiday tradition. Although the prime rib was tasty, mine was a little overcooked (medium instead of medium-rare). I would've rather had the chef err on the rare side--yes, I like my piece of meat mooing and oozing at me. The first several bites were nevertheless incredibly satisfying--the prime rib melted in my mouth like butter... but better. I didn't care too much for the Salad Bowl (sizable but not super), however, the other sides were scintillating--mashed potatoes with gravy, Yorkshire pudding, and creamed corn. Who knew that Yorkshire pudding, designed by those crafty Brits to fill people cheaply, could be that good? My prime rib dried up because I sopped up its juices with the pudding. Yum yummy. The creamed corn was equally fantastic that I was inspired to make it for Christmas this year. Although one of my friends was over an hour late and almost jeopardized our reservation that I made a month in advance, the food here left me feeling so warm and fuzzy that I spared him an ass-kicking via stilettos. It was Thanksgiving after all and I was feeling generous. We finished dinner with tiramisu, which was completely gratuitous because our server screwed up the bill. I won't get into that, though, since I did eat the tiramisu. =D 3.5 stars until I get my piece of meat and get it medium-rare.</review>

	<review>I can't really add on anything that hasn't been said in the 1600+ other reviews. My group of friends normally do an annual Christmas but we delayed it all the way until February this year. We made a reservation way ahead of time and changed it when some people couldn't make it without any problems. Overall, dinner was goood. I think the girls ordered the City Cut, but I think we should've gone with the King Henry for a couple bucks more. Oh, we also found out that if you don't want the salad, you can order the prime rib a la carte (for the City Cut) and save a little bit. However, everything was delicious--the bread, salad (made at our table side), popovers, fresh cornbread!, and prime rib (with a side of creamed spinach and mashed potatoes). I also requested the bone-in so I got that (: . I'm not normally a big meat eater, but for a juicy, tender, high-quality piece of prime rib, I'm anything it wants me to be. DROOL.  The only thing that was a little puzzling was that we all ordered our prime rib medium, but we received varying levels of bloodiness in/on our slices. Also, note that if you finish your prime rib, you can get a complimentary English cut slice, but you can't bring it home! Our waitress was friendly, but since it was a busy Friday night, she was MIA most of the time... understandable though. Overall, a very pleasant experience and another item crossed off my Big Eat list. (:</review>

	<review>Woof.  Still full from my first house of prime rib experience last night.  This place is totally rad.  Love the simple menu options: how thick, mashed or baked, corn or spinach.  I wasn't blown away by my corn, but everything else was just delightful.  Went with the King Henry cut and oh man, did I get a huge cut of delightful prime beef.  The jus (or sauce?) that accompanied it was just prime time for dipping that yorkshire pudding in as well.  So, next time I may just skip that side and head right for the extra slice of prime rib once done.  Nice tableside service including salad spinning, and obviously getting your cut done right by you make things even better.  Pretty pricey, but if you've got some cash burning a hole in your pocket this is a great place to do that.  I was brought here for my birthday, and wasn't even able to fit in a dessert.  Even better reason to come back again.</review>

	<review>We don't eat at fancy schmancy restaurants often, but this is one of our favorites!  One suggestion:  you either come early right when they open for dinner, or make reservations way in advance!  This place is popular especially on weekends and a 2+ hour wait is not uncommon.  Either way, this place makes up for it and satisfies you to the bone. I don't even know where to start...  Let's go with the salad.  YUM YUM YUM!  My brother is definitely not a salad eater and thinks they're for rabbits, but he gobbles HoPR's salad down!  That says something right there!  It's true, their salad is the best I've ever tasted.  Then comes the bread.  I honestly don't remember if the bread is good or not, but what makes it memorable is the waitstaff that comes around and brushes your crumbs off the table!  Makes you wanna crumble some more up just to have them comes by and sweep it.  But no, that would be evil...  And then comes your meal...  Simply, yet beautifully plated tableside, you get your yorkshire pudding and the sinfully delicious creamed spinach.  It may not sound appetizing, but it's oh so good.  And since it's spinach, it has to be healthy right?(even if it's made of heavy cream and bacon)   And then...  For the piece de resistance... The Prime Rib!!!  You look at the menu and all the different cuts.  One catches your attention.  You say "no...  that's too much.  I'd look like the cow that it is if I ordered it."  But your stomach says "get it... and bring it home if there's anything left...  Mmm MEAT!  Raawrrr!"  So you turn to your waiter, politely smile, and in hushed tones, order the King Henry cut.  Your plate comes back to you with half a cow on it!  Ok ok, maybe not half a cow, but a darn good portion of it!  The angels start singing, a light shines down on you, your eyes widen, and you cut into the succulent, perfectly cooked piece of sexy meat.  Heaven...</review>

	<review>The last time I ate here was years ago and I was able to revisit HoPR recently to the greeting of the same warm restaurant that I remembered it to be. Unfortunately, the prime rib fell way short of expectations. Throughout those years when I was craving HoPR but never found the opportunity to go, I had this memory of an extremely flavorful, juicy, piece of prime rib. When I sat down this time with my King Henry cut and finally went after the much anticipated piece of meat, I was pleasantly disappointed. The prime rib was cooked to the right consistency and color but the flavors were simply not there. Most of the flavors lingered around the crust as it should, but come the middle areas, there was just no flavor at all. I had to drench it in the au jus in order for me to finish the massive cut. Of course, the pancake/popover thingy was just as delicious as I remembered it to be. I'm quite disappointed at how far HoPR has fallen. Unless our table of six was just unlucky with that particular cart of prime rib... I will give HoPR a 3.5</review>

	<review>NOTICE: If you're vegan or vegetarian you might not want to read this because this restaurant is all about MEAT, in huge portions. I really love this place because it reminds me of when I was a little kid and my grandparents would take us here for dinner for special occasions. It pretty much feels the same way it did back then. It's a warm comfortable place with great service and wonderful food that seems from another time.  My parents used to come to this restaurant when they were children too so it's been around a long time. I always have the same thing: the House of Prime Rib cut. It's plenty to eat but I don't feel as if I'm pigging out completely. The main course comes with a great salad mixed at your table, baked potato, creamed spinach, and Yorkshire pudding. It's an older style of eating with everything included in the price of the entree. It may be pricey to some folks, but it's worth every penny. Just great food, good service and a feeling that the owners care about their customers and treat them well.  I keep going back over and over again.</review>

	<review>I loved it. I thought everything was outstandingly delicious. My British cut prime rib was AMAZING - tender, flavorful goodness. The sourdough was so fresh that touching it burned my fingers. The creamed spinach was like the best ever. I don't normally like beets, but in their salad...WOWIE! I highly recommend this for a special night with people you love.</review>

	<review>Great meat portions!  Delicious yorkshire pudding with pan-drippings! Came to the restaurant with my family and some foreign guests (total 12 of us).  The salad was decent but don't waste stomach space for that!  Leave it for the prime rib!  Had a fantastic time with great service!  As usual the restaurant was crowded, as it should be!  Reservations highly recommended.  Valet parking available.</review>

	<review>I'm a go with a flow kind of gal and I rarely make reservations. I am the first come first serve kind of  person and my boyfriend probably loves me for that. We came here on a full house Saturday night and boy we were lucky. They have about 8 chairs available at the bar and two people got up within 15 minutes and we a were able to snag a place to sit. We got amazing service by the bus boy and bartenders. We had delicious food handed right to us. The only con sitting at the bar top is that they don't cut your meat right in front of you, but that was okay with me. I got the house cut and convinced my boyfriend to do the same. It was juicy, delicious, and cook to perfection! I loved the cream of spinach  and the baked potato came with all the fixings-bacon, sour cream, chives. When I'm in town, I would definitely come back with an empty stomach.</review>

	<review>The prime rib here was faultless - it had better be first-rate when it is in your establishment's name.  Other than that it was pretty mediocre - the atmosphere is pleasant and cozy but the service was rote and uninspiring although attentive. The menu needs to be updated and expanded a little.  Come on - are you telling me you can't find a couple of some appetizers and vegetables dishes to brighten it up?  The salad was the least appetizing dish - could have been as good as picking up leftovers from a nearby table.</review>

	<review>3 stars for the food and 5 stars for the service....so 4 stars average! Came here for a birthday dinner because the birthday girl had never been here before.  We were early for our reservation so we had a seat in the bar.  There was only one server running around the bar area so it took her a while to get to us, but when she did she was very friendly and our drinks came pretty quickly.  The apple martini is delicious, by the way, as is the lemon drop. We were soon seated in a booth for dinner and were each given a delicious moist piece of cornbread.  I was debating whether to save it to eat with dinner but then it was gone.  Oh well. We each went with the House cut medium rare prime rib.  My friends got the side of creamed corn and I had the creamed spinach.  Our server was nice enough to make sure we got more cornbread (the birthday girl was a huge fan of it!).   They do a neat thing of assembling your salad tableside.  The salad had lots of different veggies in it, but a little bit too much dressing for my liking.   The sides were pretty average.  I liked the spinach more than the creamed corn, though.  For the beef, it's pretty flavourful but I feel like I've had juicier cuts elsewhere, for less.   However, service throughout the evening was top-notch.  Along with the cornbread, at the end of our meal we were offered carry out bags (despite our voracious appetites we still had some leftovers) and my prime rib bone was neatly wrapped in tin foil, and my spinach was topped off to become a fresh whole serving!   Would I go back?  Probably...they really treat you well!   But I would probably try other places around too to see if they compare in terms of food.</review>

	<review>The House of Prime Rib is totally amazing. The decor is straight out of the Rat Pack era, the prime rib is better than anything you'll ever find anywhere else, the yorkshire pudding is unbelievably yummy, the salad is addictive like crack and this is the only place that could ever get me to each creamed spinach (oooooh, bacon). This place rocks.</review>

	<review>Having dinner at the House of Prime Rib was certainly one of the many highlights of my trip to San Francisco. 2,900+ reviews indicates there's something special going on, but, in all honesty, no matter how enticing and detailed these Yelp reviews are, it's impossible to fathom the sheer magnitude of how good it is until you experience it for yourself. My date and I arrived promptly for an 8pm reservation. The restaurant was completely packed. In spite of our reservation, we had to wait approximately 30 minutes before our table was made available. The House of Prime Rib exudes a manly, rustic feel that is a cross between an old steakhouse and a Medieval banquet hall. Completely casual. Extremely loud. Yes, every table was crammed full of obnoxious San Fracisco tourists and locals that had abandoned all decorum and, instead, embraced their primitive natures as the gluttonous carnivores they were. Indeed, I was surrounded by throngs of heathens and Philistines that were devouring cuts of meat so fast that the staff couldn't clear the bones off the plates fast enough. Upon being seated, and after observing the surrounding atmosphere, we were served a hot loaf of bread and butter. Our waitress was extremely sweet and helpful with the menu, but she was ridiculously overwhelmed and overworked. Words can't describe how busy this restaurant is. As such, the lag time in taking our orders and obtaining our food was very long. Nevertheless, it was definitely worth the wait. I was starving, and I chose the Henry VIII Cut, a portion made for "king-sized appetites." My more conservative dining companion opted for the City Cut, a portion for the "lighter appetite." Each prime rib dinner comes with salad, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, Yorkshire pudding and horseradish sauce. * The salad was one of the best salads that I've ever had. Composed of fresh greens, a Russian-like dressing, beets and egg, it was staggeringly good. In fact, not long after we returned home from our vacation, we attempted to replicate it. * My Henry VIII cut of prime rib was cooked perfectly to my liking, was rich in flavor, and hit my sweet spot. * The creamed spinach caused me to swoon. * The Yorkshire pudding and mashed potatoes sealed the deal by placing me in a complete carbohydate coma. Sheer gluttony. No other way to describe the dinner. This was probably one of the largest meals that I've ever consumed, evidenced by the fact that I almost had be craned from my chair upon departure.  I don't even want to think about how many calories I crammed down my gullet, but it was obscene. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed by the food. Because of the popularity, however, you do need to factor in additional time for your dinner. I believe we were at the restaurant for about 3 or more hours. Patience is certainly a virtue for this experience; therefore, if you're running short on time, dont' even bother. I would typically deduct for the foible of slow service, but this is one of the very few times that the mind-blowing nature of the meal completely trumps my bitches and concerns about  staff efficiency. The House of Prime Rib will certainly be a regular destination of mine when I find myself back in SF.</review>

	<review>I have been eating here several times a year for about 50 years, starting when I was in a high-chair. The menu remains remarkably unchanged during this time except for the prices increasing linearly with time, the addition of cornbread (sorry, not for me), and the addition of a single fish selection for the non-believers. It has always been a family favorite and is still my absolute favorite restaurant anywhere. The prime rib is pretty consistently excellent - oh, yes there has been an occasional visit where the meat was merely "simply tasty" but in the countless times I have been here that is very infrequent. If you like prime rib, then this is indeed Mecca. The baked potatoes are huge and are very good or so my dinner-mates have reported many times. Wait times without reservations can be long, but the bar is fantastic and a great place to wait. An insider's tip: ask for the au jus on the mashed potatoes instead of the normal gravy. Bonus tip: you can always ask for free seconds of everything; they will bring you a little more beef, with a little potatoes, a little creamed spinach, and even more Yorkshire Pudding. You just have to ask.</review>

	<review>Definitely make a reservation before you go. I'm not a critic of prime rib but I do enjoy it. Even though they're known for their prime rib I was a bit curious to see what else the House had to offer; however, when I asked for the menu the server ignored me and just told our party to get the prime rib. The sides are crummy and small portioned. The meat was only lukewarm when served ... overall just okay and nothing impressive. Lawry's for the win.</review>

	<review>Brought my bf here for his birthday dinner. This place is really nice on the inside! A lot of people were dressed up! This is a meat lovers dream, which is why I brought the bf here.  The portions are huge here. I got the smallest possible slice of prime rib and it was still a bit much for me.  I loved the sides, cream corn and mashed potatoes...yum! They have the meat carver on the side which is really cool too! The service was great and we definitely enjoyed our meal.  If someone's in town or you have a special occasion to celebrate, check out House of Prime Rib! Be sure to make reservations!</review>

	<review>Old San Francisco, as good as it gets.   I have been coming to the House of Prime Rib for years - and no wonder.  It is the desired food of professional athletes, highly acclaimed food critics and some of the city's most prominent political figures.  Although some locals may frown upon the tourist appeal, it may cause one to wonder: Why do the tourists and locals continue to frequent this place in droves? Why is every table still full and bustling at 9 p.m.? Why are people still being seated at 11 p.m., only to digest a heavy helping of beef right before bed? The answer: Because it is damn good food.  If you love prime rib, that is.  Vegetarians, vegans, and self-proclaimed foodie hipsters need not apply. If you like a nice side of beef with a healthy heap of salad and some stick to your ribs creamed spinach and potatoes, you will love all that this oldie but goodie has to offer. The salad is completely generous and almost not needed.   The prime rib, always juicy and never over seasoned, goes down almost too easily when paired with a great glass (or bottle, ahem) of red wine.  The creamed spinach, mashed potatoes and rich Yorkshire pudding are simple solutions to a hard week at the office.  Although the atmosphere is somewhat 70's, I find it charming and especially inviting around the holidays. This will always be one of my favorite go-to's in the city.</review>

	<review>First time: came here for a friend's birthday for a table of 8 or so. We were seated promptly since everyone didn't show up together. The food took a little long, but it was worth the wait. the cream corn was great, but we didn't get the bread pudding? Oh well. The meal was really good. I got the king's cut that time, and i could barely finish it. Second time: Came here for a pre-father's day dinner for 4. I came here since i liked it so much the first time. The service from the waiter that night was lacking. he might be new, but he wasn't the best. We ordered a glass of wine, and he forgot it. really? i understand he was serving 3 other tables, very small tables, but he couldn't handle it very well. he was a nice guy though. BUT, this time. my king's cut was SMALL. it was more like something between the city cut and the house cut. it was A LOT smaller than the piece I ordered last time from house of prime rib. the waiter ALSO forgot our cream corn. ALL of our cream corn didn't come until I was also done with my meal. this time, my prime rib WAS NOT big and juicy, it was a bit dry, and just small. I finished the piece like it was nothing. Definately not planning to come back here again.</review>

	<review>I am always satisfied whenever I come here. I come at least once a year and the only reason why is that I need to make reservations at least 3 months ahead of time. I came here last Friday with some friends and it was perfect. I always get the house cut medium rare with mashed potatoes and corn. The waiter was perfect, he offered my seconds and it was so good that I would have gone for thirds. YUM! I need to come back here soon in the next couple months.</review>

	<review>Love this place!  Their prime rib is oh so yummy.  I think it's the English cut that I get ... And so are their salads that are tossed right in front of you.  Then there is the pudding which is unique, given to you with your meal.  If you're in the mood for prime rib, this is your place.  Everytime I have come here it has been extremely packed though!  And, they won't seat you unless your whole party is there.  But, it is delicious.  If it's your birthday they'll take a pic with a polaroid camera and give you the pic as a momento.  I thought that was cool too!</review>

	<review>This is one of my dad's favorite places to eat when he comes to visit. And I must say he has a good reason to enjoy it so much. The wait on the weekend is terrible, even when you have a reservation, but the staff is very accommodating and will sit you in the bar area until your table is ready. Just make an early reservation. The atmosphere and the ambiance are fantastic and I love the old, original trollies that they cut the prime rib in. Simple food (only prime rib on the menu) that is great quality for a good price. Have fun when you go here.</review>

	<review>This place is LEGIT. One of the best date spots to take someone, maybe on the fourth or fifth date. Plan to spend about $50-$60 a person. These prices are very fair. Make a reservation! Be sure to do this! When you walk in and you're still waiting for a table, they will tell you to wait at the lounge or bar. We stayed at the bar and ordered a drink. I got a Cosmopolitan and my eating partner got a Green Apple Martini, classic drinks. They were about $10 each but they fill up a martini glass and give you another shaker full of the drink for you to pour on your own. That was a first. Unless you're good at eating a lot of food, you should be good with the House of Prime Rib Cut or even the smaller City Cut. Don't let your appetite trick you. You get a lot of sides with the meal so you'll get filled up for sure. The bread is bomb too! Some of the food (salad and baked potato) is prepared right in front of you also which is cool to watch. Seeing the salad be prepared is interesting, don't miss that. Walk-through of dinner: You'll start with some bread. It's warm, YES. The Salad Bowl is BIG. We didn't want to finish it so that we would have room for the rest of dinner. It's pretty good, but it's a lot of leaves and the dressing is tasty. Next, get the BAKED POTATO, not the mashed potatoes, it's so worth it watching them make it and it's damn good. The Fresh Creamed Spinach is alright I didn't really like it. The Yorkshire Pudding is sort of just like some flat bread. This is the only thing I left on the plate after being full. The only drawback is that it might be a little hard to find parking but that's a minor issue compared to all the good things this place has. Bottom line is GO HERE it's a good service, good atmosphere, and good experience.</review>

	<review>Once dubbed 'The Happiest Place on Earth" by my group of friends, House of Prime Rib or "HPR", like Disneyland, is truly a magical experience.  The atmosphere is festive and lively.  The drinks are strong.  The Horseradish is nuclear.  The Beef is rare and heavenly! The Skinny:  The menu includes Prime Rib and only Prime Rib (save for the fish of the day which usually has the consistency of galvanized rubber) .  This leaves you with only one choice: Which Cut of Prime Rib do go for?  I always choose the City Cut which includes the bone and a hefty slab of rare beef.  I would stay away from the English Cut (you are served an English Cut if you so choose to have seconds or thirds), and the King Henry the VIII cut is excessive.   Also, of note:  If you are starving, do realize that you will not be seated immediately and there can be a good sized wait, especially on a Friday or Saturday night. Every slab of beef is lovingly carved out of a silver "Zeppelin" of Beef right at your table, and you are served up sides of salad, mash or baked potatoes, creamed spinach, and Yorkshire pudding.  My only other piece of advice would be to not fill up on the mountain of salad they offer and go straight for seconds.  Also for those Horseradish aficionados, ask for the straight cut horseradish.  It packs way more of a punch than the weak, creamy side they give you with the meal.  On a side note, I once ate an entire cup of the straight cut for a bet and won a Snowboard for my troubles.  So worth the hour long stomach ache!   In closing, HPR is not for the faint of heart, light eaters, or even a great place to bring a date.  What it is: a loud, raucous, bloody, and utterly perfect venue for large groups who want to have a gut-busting good time.  HPR is not pretentious, it's not apologetic, and it has been serving amazing prime rib to San Franciscans for decades.</review>

	<review>This is another restaurant that earned a 'middle' star.  The first time we ate here, it was excellent.  The meat was perfectly cooked, the sides were delicious.  Service was fantastic. Second visit, the meat was so salty we couldn't eat it.  The Yorkshire pudding had no flavor.  I don't know what happened, but it was not good.  The server didn't care when we told him about the saltiness of the prime rib.  Obviously, there's not much he could do, but it would have been nice to get some reaction that the meat was not good. We haven't been back for a third visit.  Maybe when/if  we do and things are hopefully better, I will change my rating.</review>

	<review>Prime Rib isn't something that I crave or must have. I do admit that this place got me to appreciate it a lot more. Once again, I didn't know what to expect with this place as well. A friend of a friend suggested it and we all went to check it out. Now, lets start with the dress attire. I say that going casual is fine but you can never go wrong with dressing up a little. The place seems a little ritzy when entering. Reservations are highly recommended as this place seems to be very popular. My entire party of 16  wasn't present at the time of reservations so the host sent us to the bar. We weren't going to be seated till everyone arrived. My friend and I ordered a cosmo that came in a little martini shaker. It served about 3 drinks for the price of $10. Not bad! They only serve prime rib at this establishment, Hence "House of prime rib." They have several types of cuts to choose from. I chose the house of prime rib cut. My other guy friends chose the king cut. It was a huge slice of meat. I should add that they slice the piece right at your table.  You also choose your accompaniment such as yorkshire pudding or salad, baked potato or garlic mashed potatoes and creamed spinach or corn.  Now if you have consumed your entire slice of prime rib, they offer you a complimentary slice. You can't go wrong with that. They stated that they "don't want anyone going home hungry. " Everything was delicious. I was impressed. The server's were great, polite, and attentive, water was being filled at a decent rate. The crumb brush was even brought out. The price for the set meal was about $35 if memory serves me right. All worth it if you want prime rib done right.</review>

	<review>If you love meat this is the place you need be.  The prime rib here is perfect.  The seasoning, the cut, just everything about the prime rib killed it for any other rib place I'd go in the future.  I'm a meat and potatoes guy but the salad is off the hook.  Service was awesome; the service was definitely not snooty like some places here in SF.  I'd definitely come back but next time around come with an empty stomach.  I was so full by the time that I got another slice to eat; I had to take the meat home.</review>

	<review>It was good, but I did not like the massed-produced feel of the food. It was cool that the prime rib was cut off of the cart (because, of course, you can't cook individual pieces of prime rib) but I did not enjoy my sides and things being scooped out like the cart was a cafeteria on wheels. Yes, most restaurant food is mass produced anyway, but for the price and reputation I would have liked them to at least make my corn/mashed potatoes/etc. look a little prettier instead of plopping them down on my plate.</review>

	<review>Way to expensive for what you get.  If you are looking for ambiance - than this is the place.  I had high expectations for this place but the prime rib was way overpriced.  There is not many selections to chose from in terms of side-dishes. A one time visit is okay but I would not go there again.</review>

	<review>First thing I'd like to say is, I don't know how anyone can be a vegetarian.  Especially not with meat tasting ooooh, so good! With that said, House of Prime Rib, or HOP as I call it, serves the BEST prime rib around.  Nor Cal, So Cal, Vegas, whatever.  Of all the prime ribs I've consumed over the years, and it's pretty much what I always order at a steakhouse, House of Prime Rib tops them all.  Now, I've been meaning to try Lawry's in Beverly Hills (Recommended by Dustin C. before he went nuts and started to not eat red meat), but that will have to wait another day.  I've been here a few times, and I've always gotten the King Henry VIII cut.  Why?  Because I think my eyes are bigger than my stomach.  First time here, after the bread, drinks, spinning salad, sides, I could not get a 2nd or 3rd helping of the finely roasted succulent meat.  Mmmmmm, I'm getting hungry yelping it.  The salad was pretty good, but I guess the show was the way they make it, or spin it right in front of us.  The bread was warm and goes well with the butter they give you.  The other sides, meh, it's OK, but I'm not here to eat veggies, I want my meat DAMMIT. My last visit here was nice as usual.  There's a waiting area where you can order a drink and munch on the snack they provide for you, but I wasn't about to get full off those snacks this time.  After ordering the Henry VIII cut, I was actually able to get a 2nd helping.  Of course, after this meat coma, I'd swear off meat for awhile, but this is totally worth it.  Get it medium rare, you won't leave disappointed.  It's hella good, I promise! Oh, btw, parking is a bitch here.  We haven't used valet yet, but we usually park like 3-4 blocks on the side streets around here.  I guess after all the meat, it's good to walk some of it off.</review>

	<review>Wow there's already 747 reviews so I guess mine will be just be lost in the mix.  I came here for as a surprise birthday party for me and somehow I was actually duped into believing we were going elsewhere.  Sad thing is I think birthday surprises never work because people always know and you have to be pretty slow to not figure it out.  So that says a lot about me! The restaurant is very nice.  It's large to severeal rooms and has a nice feel to it.  It's hard to describe but it just has a comfortable vibe.  The service was very good and of course the food was great.  You also get very large portions.  Along with the prime rib you get mashed creamed spinach and mashed potatoes and salad.  You also get this pudding bread that's pretty good.  Overall the experience was very good and I would recommend this place to anyone and for my birthday the waiter even took a group polaroid for me to keep.</review>

	<review>I can't even begin to say how DELICIOUS House of Prime Rib is! Your first glimpse is a lot of wine bottles--but very elegantly placed. It seems sort of old fashioned, with a fireplace and comfy, highbacked chairs, stools, and a bar, but the waiters and waitresses are very polite, clean, calm, and give all their attention to you. It's well lighted and is very warm and peaceful. You can hear people laughing, talking, and clinking their forks and wine glasses together. House of Prime Rib has several rooms, each with a unique style. There are quite a few candles. It's like walking through an old, famous house! Well, enough about the atmosphere--now to the food! The steak is so soft and so expertly cooked, it melts in your mouth! Literally! I couldn't get enough of it! You have a "personal" chef who cooks all the steak for one section of the House, and our chef was named Francisco. Very ironic. SF should be so proud to have such a classic, delicious attachment to the wonders of their famous city! ~On a different note, I would advise that you stay away from well-done steak, as it gets very dry. Also, House of Prime Rib is a little bit pricey, but completely worth it. You feel like royalty while you're there. Remember to dress up a little--it would be embarrassing to look like a slob in sweats while people around you sit in dresses and suits!</review>

	<review>I must admit, the prime rib was pretty good.  But the horrible customer service counters any positive remarks about this restaurant!  The last time I went there for a friend's birthday, I swear our waiter was either drunk or just incredibly rude and stupid.  With a glowing red face, he stumbled and pushed the table towards us, managed to drop the pudding on my lap, didn't really apologize for it, and didn't even bother coming by our table periodically to ask us how we're doing.  Anyway, they really need to do something about the quality of their service!!!</review>

	<review>Too much food! Definitely come with an empty stomach because it seems like the eating is never ending!...It starts off with the bread, which was good, but don't fill up on it because the corn bread was way better.  I ordered the a la carte English Cut since I'm not a fan of big chunks of meat, so the thinner slices were perfect for me.  The beef was juicy enough and not too dry.  The a la carte order had all the accompaniments minus the salad, which I was able to try.  I love salad, but this didn't do it for me.  The Yorkshire pudding tasted like a puff pastry and it went well with the beef juices. The creamed spinach and mashed potatoes were both heavy, and everything came in good enough portions because I had plenty of left overs for a second meal.   We had a group of 7 and with reservations, we were seated once the entire party arrived.  It's a fun place to go to with a group...I think I was so distracted with the atmosphere and with chatting with the people I was with that I kinda neglected the food.</review>

	<review>I've been to the HoPR at least a dozen times now, but now I feel like the place is in decline. I made reservations two weeks in advance yet waited for my family to be seated nearly an hour  when it wasn't crowded.   It was my birthday and my family asked where I wanted to go, expecting it would be another of my glorious Steakfests. I gleefully suggested House of Prime Rib, hoping they would experience the joy I had in trips past...  alas this time it was not to be. The bar waitress was upset about something that had nothing to do with us and took forever taking and delivering our drink orders (by then my martini had been watered down to slush by the ice in the shaker) and didn't even bring the bar snacks until after our drinks were done. Seeing Gus after we first walked in lifted my spirits, but after his fourth pass at us, promising personally to seat us and then not delivering a half hour later, I could only tell past stories of how he used to be a special host, despite the obvious disbelief on the faces of my family. I had built him up to Herb Caen status by now and had hoped to introduce Gus to my rambunctious nephew who had surprisingly set a new record by being well behaved the entire hour while we waited, hoping to establish a new HoPR generation. Unfortunately Gus did not come by to seat us, or even bother to make the rounds in our room during our entire dinner. On top of that I ordered the King Henry VIII portion and finished it, as usual! ... and was not offered the customary extra serving. While I always decline, I was nonetheless insulted on my birthday once again. The food at HoPR was again very good, but unfortunately the service has taken a noticeable dip. The new staff needs to get their act together. This was my first time being disappointed by Gus, hence the loss of only one star, but as his performance and legacy continue to wane, so will my devotion to HoPR as a SF landmark.</review>

	<review>Came here for my sisters birthday and to be quite honest with you, i've never been to a strictly prime rib only place. Needless to say, I didn't really know what to expect. The order comes with a salad, the prime rib, and a desert. What's cool though, is that the salad is made right in front of you. What's not cool though, is that the sprinklings they give you for the salad is just powdered MSG...true fact, don't believe me? Look at the back of the sprinkling container, MSG. If you get the largest size of prime rib like i did, you are granted another and free piece of prime rib (small of course) unfortunately you can't take this free piece home and you must finish it inside the restaurant. Well long story short, i got 2 bites into it and...baaarrrrrffff. Just kidding, i just got really full and stopped. Then the button on my pants blew right off. The end. Tips and Pointers: -Do not, under no circumstances, do not sprinkle the MSG powder on your salad -The waiters are weird and overly theatrical, freaked me out man. -Baked potato was top notch -Prices are decent for great cuts of prime rib -Interior is very very odd, needs an update really badly [APPROVED]</review>

	<review>Came here during a weekend visit to San Francisco. This place is basically the Lawry's of northern California. The decor is fancy, the service is attentive, and the prime rib is cut in front of you from the carving station. At House of Prime Rib, you have the option of choosing between a baked potato or mashed potatoes, and your party is given a complimentary Polaroid at the end of your meal. I still think Lawry's has better creamed corn though. The only side that was better here was the yorkshire pudding. But let's stay focused.. It's called House of Prime Rib, not House of Yorkshire Pudding.</review>

	<review>The food here is splendid, but damn... I never want to eat here again!  I have never been so uncomfortably full in my life and I got the city cut!  The salad was amazing and really fun to see them make!  The creamed spinach had bacon in it, which was an added plus! The bread to begin with was warm and crunchy at the same time!  My cousin had the King Henry VIII cut....after he finished they gave him three more slabs for free...it was not fun watchin him shovel in his last few bites!</review>

	<review>I was brought here for my birthday. I anticipated that my dining experience wouldn't be worth the price. I already knew I wasn't much of a prime rib person, and my palette probably can't discern quality meat if I thought their prime rib was so-so. Yes, it was tender. However, the flavor wasn't really there; I've had better from my mom or my friends' cooking.   However, the dishes aside from the entrée were astounding. The sourdough bread was soft and warm and fresh. I had to keep reminding myself and my dining partner not to fill up on bread. The cornbread was so good. Warm and crisp and flavorful. The salad--I want that dressing recipe. Though they did drench our salad. Kind of gross, but with dressing this delicious, I didn't mind as much as I usually would. The baked potato loaded with bacon bits and sour cream and chives and what looked like way too much butter (but hey, if I'm going to let myself indulge it'll be on my birthday). This was actually my favorite part of the meal. The rest of the sides were all right. I didn't care much for the creamed corn or creamed spinach. The mashed potatoes were good, but it's not that hard to make good mashed potatoes. Of course, the theatrics of our waiter were quite entertaining. He tossed (or should I saw, spun?) the salad right at our table, as well as put together the delicious baked potato right in front of us. Unfortunately, we were against a wall of the restaurant, so we didn't get a close view of the carving of our prime rib. Rather, it was abruptly brought to us. Oh well. We were seated in sight of the fireplace with clear views of the Christmas decorations still living the walls of the interior. Overall ambiance was very homey and warm. However, as my dining partner remarked, it's noisy. He expected it to be a relatively quiet place for fine dining. Definitely not the case. Towards the end of the meal, a couple of waiters came up to me with a scoop of chocolate ice cream lit with a candle and sang me happy birthday. That was nice. They also took our photograph, printed it, and presented it to us in a House of Prime Rib cardstock frame. Cute. I left trying to overcome a food coma after being stuffed--uncomfortably so. I personally don't enjoy that feeling too much. Next time, I think I'll go somewhere more suited to my personal tastes. Overall, the experience was memorable. But for the price, I'd expect to enjoy the entrée more than the sides and salad. As for the price, we shared. And our bill total came out to be about $60 including tip. Yay. If you share, it's $7.50 for extra sides/plates. Honestly, I don't think one should be eating an entire portion of prime rib themselves. Even sharing, we were both so stuffed and left food on our plates.</review>

	<review>My little sister was raving about this place for ages so on the event of my mom's boyfriend's bday, we all decide to go. And what did I think? SUCKSVILLE USA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Sorry Monica). 1) The waiter had a giant stick up his ass and was extremely passive aggressive. My mom kept trying to crack jokes to break him but he maintained this icy "politeness" the entire time and it was really getting on my nerves. 2) The steak was salty and tasted like it had been marinated-no, wait, PICKELED- in artificially flavored beef broth. For steak this expensive, I wanted to be taste the actual meat. I felt like I was sucking on a beef boullion cube. Which leads to my other beef (no  pun intended) with this restaurant. 3) Salty beef made me extremely thirsty and water wasn't cutting it. So I ordered a coke. They had it on tap so I assumed there would be refills, right? Snooty-ice-princess waiter delivers said coke to me in a tiny, tiny glass FILLED with ice and what was equivalent to about 2 teaspoons of cola. "no refills" he reminded me. Bitch! 4) If you want to a to-go box, you have to eat at least HALF of the meal. what kind of shit is that? if I want to take home ALL my food because it was too nasty to eat in the first place, I'll do it goddammit! ok, enough said. Don't go here.</review>

	<review>Came here on a Monday night with a group of 9 of my friends. I've heard all of this hype about the place and was super excited to see whats the big hubbub. It was pretty busy for a Monday night, I cant imagine how crazy it must be on the weekends! I ordered the King cut which is $40, and the BIGGEST cut! The smallest cut is $33, so you might as well get the big one and pack the rest home! +1 Very Cozy atmosphere. The bathrooms were really clean, I felt like i was in a country snow club. I love that they have a fire place. +1 Great service! The hostess was very hospitable, the bar waitress was nice. Our server ( i wish i remembered her name... but we asked he what nationality she was and shes Mongolian!), she was SUPER! She was very knowledgeable, fast, checked in on us often, made sure the water was always full, got all the food right, and was able to answer any questions that we had. LOVE HER!! THANKS FOR THE GREAT SERVICE! + The food was okay. I think i just expected a lot. The menu is simple. All prime rib or a choice of seafood. *You get mashed potato OR baked potato. I got baked potato and it was good. I packed it home because there was no way i could finish it. *The salad was good. They mix it table side. I wish i was able to get my dressing on the side because it was just wayyy to much dressing for me, but the other people at the table liked it. *The Yorkshire pudding was kinda weird. It was a fried piece of bread, which wasn't sweet or salty. But other people at the table used it to soak up the sauces * complimentary sourdough bread which i loved! *The steak was cooked great. I ordered it Medium rare. moooo.... +1 they take a group picture and put it in a paper frame for you at the end of your dinner :) Im not a big prime rib person, so i would rather go to Ruth Chris. -1 The creamed spinach was kinda weird to me, maybe im just being a picky little kid. It seemed slimey. THe yorkshire pudding was also bland. I dont knwo if thats the way its suppose to taste though. ***VALET SUCKS!! DONT GET VALET! i came here on Monday night 11/15, so it wasn't that busy. After having a good dinner we gave the ticket to the valet. They brought up a green car that WAS NT OURS. I politely told the valet that it wasn't the right car, and he POINTED TO OUR CAR DOWN THE STREET and said "you're car is down there". Last I checked, i thought the reason for valet is so they they bring it to the front. It was just one guy there, so maybe we just were unlucky to get stuck with the @$$hole of the valet drivers. Save yourself the $8! It totally left a sour ending to a good night! Ugh! I would return to HOPR if it was someones birthday or soemthing. but management really needs to do something about valet @$$.</review>

	<review>Used to be my favorite steak house in San Francisco.  Their incredibly long wait times--even when you have a reservation--make this a place to avoid.  Hopefully, some day they will deal with this issue.</review>

	<review>With high expectations due to rave reviews, I took my bf here for his birthday last year. I don't remember how long we had to wait, but it was quite some time.  Beside the dim lighting, there's nothing romantic about this place and the tables were too close to each other.   The prime rib and side dish did not look that tantalizing as I eat with my eyes first. Needless to say, I came out disappointed.</review>

	<review>The House of Prime Rib is one of those places that are classically stuffy by nature. It has the feel of an old time steakhouse. Rich colors and plenty of waiters and chefs moving about. It really is a great experience though. They bring a rolling cart that contains the prime rib right to your table and the chef cuts it right in front of you.  It wasn't dry at all and seemed nice and tender. Add to that mash potatoes and gravy, sourdough bread (a must when you visit SF), and it was swimming in au jus sauce (just how I like it). Our server was great and always around to make sure thing was fine. The manager even came by and made sure everything is alright. We parked on a side street and had reservations (highly recommended). If you are visiting the city, I would try and make the trek to the House of Prime Rib!</review>

	<review>This is my favorite place for prime rib and I measure all prime ribs against HOPR!  The prime rib is always done to perfection as I order it...medium rare, juicy, tender, Good!!  Oh and the house salad is awesome!  It taste like thousand island dressing but there' s something else that perks it up...not sure what it is but it is good!!   We came here early...the earliest I've every eaten dinner! 5:30pm!  I've never come here this early and was shocked that it was so crowded at this time!  I know HOPR is crowded any day of the week but never realized how crowded it can be even this early!  Well, we bellied up to the bar to wait for a table cause we didn't have a rsvp.  I had a very enjoyable conversation about wine with the bartender, Nate, sharing our wine stories.  He overheard I was here for an early B-day dinner so he offered to buy me a nice glass of port as an after dinner drink...very nice of him.   It only took about one martini (about 1/2 hr) until we were summoned to our table.  If you don't have a rsvp and the wait is usually about an hour to 1 &amp; 1/2 hr. I had my usual...English cut medium rare.  For those not familiar with HOPR, you basically order your cut (size) of prime rib and your dinner comes with warm sourdough bread (yum!) to start and with your entree you get a choice of bake potato or mashed potatoes with either creamed corn or creamed spinach (corn was an option as of about 6-7 yrs ago) and Yorkshire pudding.  The prime rib is carved at tableside and served with au jus (note: if you like your meat medium you might want to consider ordering it medium rare b/c the au jus slightly cooks the meat as you are eating...more true I think when you order it "English cut" cause it's a thinner slice of the meat). As with the previous couple dozen times I've been here it was a great meal and the prime rib is the "creme de la creme" of prime rib to my opinion.  Also, the wines are very reasonably priced.  Bottom line...if you enjoy a good prime rib...there is no substitue!</review>

	<review>We made a reservation for 9, was seated at 9:30right next the server station. We actualy saw the meat at around 10;30.  the prime rib was overly fatty. No one in the group of four of us would return. The drinks were good. That saved the night as a whole.</review>

	<review>The worst part is I used to love this place and then it started going downhill. When I'm shelling out some serious cash for dinner at what looks like a nice restaurant I don't want to have to be seated next to a group of construction workers or a family who's idea of dressing up is matching sweatsuits. BUT I also want to be attended to in a pleasent manner by the waiters and waitresses and have my food cooked correctly for that piece of coin I'm going to be laying down. $100 easy for 2 people and a couple of drinks and tip so in the future I suggest you do this if you want prime rib 1. Buy a Prime Rib at a good butcher shop (I suggest Andronico's or Guerra's Meats) 2. Buy some Montreal steak seasoning 3. Rub the seasoning on the  prime rib and don't be shy with it. 4. Put it in the oven @ 475 for 15 minutes then drop it to 350 and cook 'til you hit about 135-145 depending on your doneness. Total cost for Prime Rib + Seaoning + electronic meat thermometer? $60 roughly feeds about 4 people and you can have them make better side dishes Feeling of accomplishment that you've just outdid an SF Landmark and not having to deal with snooty bitchy help? Priceless</review>

	<review>I've been here a number of times.  The prime rib is pretty good.  I prefer the prime rib at the Magic Castle in L.A. as it's all a bit more flavorful (and probably higher in sodium) but since I'm not a member there and it is 600 miles away this is one of the spots I go to get my prime rib on. You don't have to order the king henry VIII cut which is their largest cut unless you really love to eat.  At the end of your meal they'll offer you a 2nd smaller cut of prime rib if you're still hungry and I hate turning down anything for free (as long as it's curable).  I'm usually happy with the queen's cut and the free offering because being frugal has never been so fabulous! (snap)^3</review>

	<review>What an awesome throwback place! my friend treated me for my birthday and i had no idea what to expect besides meat. but this was outstanding. watching this place run was like good reality tv. this place runs like a well oiled machine - it was really cool to watch! service was amazing - anything we needed was brought right away. the ambiance of the place made me feel as if i had stepped back in time. the prime rib was fantastic - as was the baked potato with fixings, creamed spinach, and au ju sauce. i'm trying to think of any reason to go back because i had such a great time!</review>

	<review>You can't visit SF without having dinner here! My girl friends were visiting from LA so last stop HPR. I'm not sure what all the fuss is about the wait time. If you make a reservation you are good to go. My girls and I even ran late for our 8pm reservation, had to valet the car, and the hostess was kind enough to take us 2 mins after we arrived. We went to the bar and didn't have time to order drinks because our table was ready. The decor was old, classic, kind of fancy, but you can have dinner in a nice pair of jeans. There was lots of couples and more of an older crowd. Thinking that this was going to be a GI-NORMOUS meal I ended up ordering the City Cut, the smallest cut they offer and I happen to be training, so anything bigger than that I have to work my butt off in the gym. Needless to say I finished my entire plate sides and all!!! Really not sure how that happened Lol I did skip the bread, but the salad was tasty and presented well. I got the creamed spinach was a perfect combination with my Prime Rib cooked medium-rare. What can I say....I like it PINK! The only bad part was that our waitress was RUDE and not friendly at all. I'm not sure what was her deal was. Dinner wasn't too bad, with a glass of wine it came out to $60 per person, but definitely a once in a blue moon kind of dinner. HPR is a must.</review>

	<review>My sister wanted to try this place on her birthday so we called a few days in advanced and got a 6:30pm reservation. When we got there it was already full house. We both ordered the House of Prime Rib cut. She had the creamy spinach on the side and I had the corn. Both came with Yorkshire pudding. The waitress tossed a salad in front of us and added some red wine sauce. I liked it but sis wasn't too excited about it. Probably because there's too much sauce. Actually I wouldn't mind less sauce but it's not too bad since it's a light sauce. The rib was great. I ordered medium rare and I think my sis' medium was better. So when I checked in before my sister got there I told them it's her birthday but I wasn't sure what they were going to do. They just said they would do something about it. When it's time to order dessert I was a little worried and wasn't sure if the waitress knew it's my sis' birthday. I had to remind her discreetly and she said "we always offer dessert, then bring out the ice cream". Since sis was already full and I didn't insist we told the waitress we wanted the check. That's when she and another waiter brought out some ice cream with a candle and sang happy birthday. It's a very nice experience. It's worth coming back for special occasion or a date, but I think it's a little over priced for a regular dinner.</review>

	<review>The house of Prime Rib serves up delicious, heaping piles of verbal/emotional excrement and that's before you even get served!  From the moment you walk in the door you're greeted with a shining smile of "shut up and wait".  You pleasantly find your own way to the bar where your waitress, who should be working at "Mels", gives you a dirty look and you know it's going to be a while before that drink hits your lips.  Which is ironic, a stiff drink is the first thing you need at House of Prime Rib.  When the pleasant troll with that "I'd rather be playing bingo" look on her face finally gets around to taking your drink order, you find your self rushed as she's short on time.  So you wait several moments as "Marge" talks to the bartender about her woes.  Eventually your drinks arrive, right as the hostess walks up to tell you "were ready for you now".  But wait, the waitress wants here money!  "I want my money bitch!"  So you're trapped.  The Hostess is speed walking away while the waitress is demanding payment.  Meanwhile you haven't gotten a sip of your drink yet!  Why Lord? You're finally seated.  Drink in hand, with the waitress ignoring someone else and the hostess barking orders in a different direction, you're ready to wait.  The atmosphere is loud and chaotic.  You try to make eyes at your waiter but all you get is a finger...the index finger.  So you try to chat with your wife but a conversation just can't be struck.  No worries, the frat boys next to you are discussing last night's conquests.  So you enjoy their exchange instead of your own.   Raising your head to locate your server again you find him running about, with purpose of course but with out conviction.  You just don't believe he's actually doing anything.  No, you're sure he's busy.  Eventually your order is taken and with a keen eye to detail and a half cocked smile your server is as pleasant as can be.  You start to relax.  All your worries start to melt and your martini takes over and fears of not being fed slowly slip away.  Oh wait, the obese guy behind you just scored a huge deal with Kinko's.  Score for him.  Now if he would just stop staring at your wife.   No need to worry, the salad is here.  This is such a treat.  The technical precision of your waiter is impressive.  It seems effortless yet he's adding the precise amounts of ingredients to make iceberg lettuce palatable.  The spinning motion of the bowl, the heights achieved by the waiter!  This is going to be good!  Now if you can find a life vest for your salad.  Yes, all that artistic talent behind the apron and my salad is asphyxiating.  That's ok, I came for the meat.  "Dam bro, get your eyes of my wife!" Hey, its ok, you know its time.  The man with the oversized silver bullet is coming your way.  Oh, he's making a stop at the obese sex offenders table.  "Yes sire, another slice?  Oh, three slices...."  Ok, here he comes.  Kart in hand, knife at the ready......serve.  At this point in the meal you forget that your wife is being undressed by Jaba.  The Hostess's barking becomes a rhythmic drum beat which lulls you into submission and the chaotic nature of this whole ensemble turns to beautiful music.  Each bite is better than the last.  The sweet flavor of creamed spinach swirls around that aromatic roast beef flavor.  You think you might be in love.  Just as you've taken your last bite of roast beef, sweet on your tongue, just as the original owners intended it to be, you find your self back under the big tent.  Where the three ring circus, which is the House of Prim Rib, plays on your emotions and toys with your head.  With the gorgeous flavor of prime rib gone you realize your dream is over.  Your wife is pissed that she ordered the fish and has just caught on that she's mentally nude in some ones head.  The frat boys got a hold of beer list and have now methodically made their way down three quarters of it.  The Hostess is giving you the stink eye wondering if by mental telepathy she could make you leave.  Of course your waiter is no where to be found, oh, he's at the bar.  You know something?  You just ate a man's meal yet feel some what less of a man.  Your stomach is saying "manly rare roast beef" yet your mind is saying "please let it end".  Could it be you can't handle the ebb and flow of this negative vibe?  Should you have gone to sushi?  What's wrong with you?  You decide its time to go.......... Let's face it.  Ever since Eddie DeBartolo, Jr. stopped taking the Forty Niners to feast on roast beefy goodness you'll find the House of Prime Rib took a back slide.  You may enjoy your meal but the sour taste left behind isn't worth the trouble.  I'm a fourth generation native and the House of Prime Rib is in my blood but you won't find me stepping one foot past that threshold.  Sorry H.O.P.R., you used to be somebody, now you're just everybody.</review>

	<review>House of Prime Rib does one thing and does it well.  The make prime rib dinners and by keeping it simple, they provide a good bang for the buck and a fun time.  There's no denying this is a well oiled machine and the staff are trained and prepared and know what to do.  You are never wanting and from the cocktails thru the end of your meal you never have the feeling of being ignored or dismissed.  There is a bit of "perfunctoriness" in that these people do one thing and they are taking care of a lot of people so if you pay attention, the bustle is also 'turn and burn' on the tables.  it's not irritating though and I enjoy the timelessness of this place.  The nostalgia is a major draw for many people.  Groups are perfect and families are welcome.  I had the King Aruthur cut with a baked potato, no creamed spinach thank you, the salad starter and a nice glass of wine.  The King Arthur cut was popular in our group as everyone had it.  Wine list is surprisingly good and despite the multiple renditions of happy birthday, we all had a great time.  Recommended!!</review>

	<review>I really love this place!  Do NOT forget to make reservation.  I've only been here once and it was PACKED! So I'm not sure how it is during normal days.   The food was great! Got myself the biggest cut of prime rib and it as delicious! Just like the rest of the reviews, the salad and sides are delicious as well.   I would most defintely come back here again!</review>

	<review>This is my absolute favorite go to restaurant for prime rib!!  My family has been going to House of Prime Rib ever since I can remember, so it's a family favorite as well.  The prime rib is consistently juicy and tender.   My mouth is watering just thinking about it!!!  It's time to make a reservation.   I love the atmosphere and the service is always excellent.</review>

	<review>I miss this place!  they serve you the best prime rib in town! Even with reservation, you might still have to wait for another 15 minutes or so, not a problem, just find a seat at the bar and order some yummy cocktails!  Then order a good red wine that go with your meat at dinner! I used to be so addicted to this place... whenever my friends wanna celebrate something or want to have some good meat, I always recommend HOPR! so much that I think I ate here like 7-8 times in one year.  That explains why I'm on a break with prime rib now :S</review>

	<review>Took the boyfriend here for a birthday dinner. Our waitress's name was Kellie, and she was very attentive. She came back to check up on us throughout the meal, and the service was quick. Even though I missed my 4:30pm reservation due to the heavy rain at the time, we were seated within 5 minutes upon arriving at around 5:30pm. We both got the English cut, which were thin slices of prime rib, and creamed corn/mashed potatoes for sides. Everything was delicious and wouldn't mind coming back :) They also put a candle in our dessert and sang him happy birthday, plus took a picture for us and printed it out into a frame for us to take home. 4 stars though, because I don't think it's absolutely the best it gets, but definitely a good place!</review>

	<review>Definitely one of the best all around meals I have ever eaten :) The prime rib was juicy and delicious, the spinach creamy, yorkshire pudding perfect, and the salad...oh the salad! It was wonderful to have a place actually bring salad plates and forks that had been previously chilled -- I hate when my salad gets soggy and warm! I didn't feel gypped in the least to be paying as much as I did for this meal because so much was brought over to eat -- a sourdough loaf to start following with a huge salad and then the meal :) We were also offered an extra slice of prime rib. Even though we were completely stuffed we managed to find room for the amazingly delicious Fantasy Cake (Chocolate cake, chocolate mousse, cheesecake, and raspberry sauce). Our server was named Miro and he was extremely personable and a joy to have wait on us! :)</review>

	<review>Thursday night 7PM reservation for two, ate around 8:30. Was seated in the smallest booth we have ever seen and when requested to move, someone came, said nothing, took the menus out of our hands and walked away. We had to run after her only to be seated in a slightly bigger booth against a wall facing a man's back. For the money, the service, the food, and the management very disappointing.</review>

	<review>it was ok.....i mean the meat was good, but the sides were overrated, ambiance was so stuffy and stiff.  and I'm hoping it was just a coincidence, so if you've never been here before, it's set up with different rooms and the room I was in, almost all the tables with the exception of (2) and it was a full room, were ASIAN......now I didn't want to jump to conclusions on how a old school steak house in SAN FRAN!! of all cities, can still be so backwards......so when I was leaving I walked into the larger main dining room, thinking it would be just a fluke, mind you this room was full too, I saw a table of 2 Asians and the rest were Caucasian.  Never coming back....grow up......</review>

	<review>I recommend you go here if you are very hungry. This place will feed you. While you are waiting grab yourself a small jar of trail mix while you drink your cocktail. Once you are seated they serve you bread. The salad is huge and the dressing is pretty good. If you are into thin cut meat than I suggest you get the English Cut. They scoop the condiments on the bake potato. I wasn't really fascinated with the cream spinach or yorkshire pudding. Oh yea, don't be surprised if you see a lot of birthdays here.</review>

	<review>How to operate at HoPR for the noobs: 1. Make a reservation. 2. Valet park when you get here. 3. Make sure your ENTIRE party has arrived. They won't seat you until you do, even with a reservation. Once you have, step up and announce this to the penguin behind the counter. 4. You'll be lead to the back room where you can see the cuts of meat being carved off, so here is where you want to ask to be seated in a booth. Make sure you stick your friends with the chairs and take the padded bench. You'll need this later to lounge in to let the meal digest properly while they squirm around in discomfort. 5. The menu is presented, don't bother looking at it - it only features one real selection - PRIME RIB. Sure, they have Fish of the day, but no one gets that. This is where you look like a pro and pick from one of these selections- - King Cut - English Cut - (some other) Cut - City Cut The difference between them, you ask? King is the thickest, (some other) is next, City is the thinnest. English cut is like the King cut, but sliced into three sections horizontally. There is a LOT of meat in this meal, so make sure you're hungry when you get here and order accordingly. Ladies, stick with the City cut unless you want to carry some home or you make a hobby of kicking ass at the local biker bar. 6. Potatoes - you'll want to picked between loaded-baked and mashed. I think you can get fries on request also, but try the loaded. Definitely the best. 7. Soup or salad - I went with the salad to tune down the damage down to my arteries from consuming so much red meat in one sitting. 8. Indulge in idle chatter till the food arrives, then ignore everyone and everything and make a dedicated effort to eat everything on your plate. Take breaks and drink water to aid the process. 9. Forgo dessert, order a 10-year old port instead. 10. Pay the bill (optional - you could run, but I don't recommend it especially if you Valet'ed out front), now depart in your best statesman-like manner. Smoke a cigar while you wait for the valet - or pretend to consult your stockbroker.</review>

	<review>Had a fantastic Father's day dinner tonight, and I have to say, this place truly lived up to my expectations. After reading various reviews on Yelp, I knew I was in for a treat, but the moment you walk in, you know you're going to experience a true San Francisco treat. It has a very old classic decor, with a very nice wood bar running the length of the restaurant. We were greeted warmly by the hosts and seated promptly. ( Make Reservations) Our server, John, was amazing. After asking if this was our first visit, which it was, he really made an effort to make sure our first trip was memorable. He gave us a solid run down of how things work, (pretty simple considering the only thing you really have to decide is what 'cut' of prime rib you want), and the rest was history. I can't say I was thoroughly blown away by the sides. To each their own on the creamed spinach, but I wasn't really there for that. I had the House of Prime rib cut, and that was plenty for me. The prime rib was tender, juicy, and cut like butter. Fantastic father's day dinner, and I have to thank the House of Prime Rib for a wonderful evening.</review>

	<review>I was unimpressed with the HPR. I wouldn't go back here. I've been to several other steak houses, and I think this is the worst of the higher end places. I prefer Alfred's for the steak, Harris, even Ruth Cris above the HPR, I am just not a fan. Once was enough for me.</review>

	<review>This is a place where you have to go to at least once if you are in San Francisco. We recently went here with a large group to celebrate my birthday! This is def.  a great place to go with if you have a large group that wants a good beef dinner and wants to be a lil loud. When you come here you have better like prime rib, 'cuz that is basically all they have on the menu! And if I remember correctly the martinis were huge! The service was great and the food was pretty awesome. It's probably not the absolute best prime rib I've ever had but it was up there.   One nice thing is that they were accommodating with the birthday cake we brought in (as most nice restaurants are). But then again they did charge us a $40 cake cutting fee. Which is the most I've ever seen a restaurant charge. It especially did not make sense to charge that when all of our meals come with dessert anyway (bread pudding). But since we decided to bring our own special dessert in and not take the dessert that came with our meal- we were charged a lot extra.Oh well, the Red Velvet Cheesecake was soooo worth it after a prime rib dinner!</review>

	<review>If I could give less than 1 star, I would.  I know now that HOPR is a poor knock-off of Lawry's in L.A....but at the time, I'd heard a lot of hype about this place, so when my husband and I made a reservation to go here for our anniversary, we did so with confidence.  This was a big mistake.  We were given a reservation for 9 pm, but the reservationist told us that if we wanted to get in around 7 pm, to come around 6:30-6:45 pm and put our names in on the wait list.  So we did.   At first, we relaxed by the fireplace in the lounge and sipped cocktails.  We nibbled on the trail mix at the table.  The hours passed.  We hung in there, figuring that at least we'd get our 9 pm reservation.  9 came and passed.  By now we were starving.  The maitre d kept reassuring us our table was coming up soon.   We weren't seated until 10 pm, an hour past our actual reservation (they really shouldn't have told us to come early if they weren't able to accomodate us!).  The service was extraordinarily slow, and while we kept trying to order, the server ignored us.  We found out there was a really large party there in their banquet room, and all the carving stations were wheeled into that room and disappeared for half an hour.   When they came out, we asked our waiter if we could be served.  He just grunted.  We waited some more.  By now, my stomach hurt because all I'd eaten for hours was some bread and a handful of trail mix several hours before.  We continued waiting.   Finally, I turned to my husband and said, let's just go to McDonald's!  We started to walk out, and the bartender asked how our meal was.  I burst into tears and told him that we waited almost 4 hours and never were served, on our anniversary, no less!  He begged us to give the restaurant a second chance, promised to get us seated and served right away.  They paraded us to the front table (which was open because it was long past dinner time and there was practically no one left in the diningroom!), and introduced our server as their best.   He took our order, and after another 15 minutes, they FINALLY brought our food...except this supposed "best server" brought my husband the wrong side orders and brought us well-done prime rib, after we'd ordered rare!  At that point, I was so miserable and hungry, I just ate.  The meat was tough and tasteless, the side dishes weren't particularly flavorful, and it wasn't worth the price.  I cook better food at home.  I lost my appetite after a few bites, and just had the rest boxed up to-go.   The tragic ending to this cautionary tale?  When they brought us the bill, we saw that they'd charged us full price!  You would have thought after the poor service, the excruciating wait, and the way the bartender had begged us to give them another chance, that they would've at least given us a discount!!  But no.  We realized we'd be scammed:  they just wanted us to stay so that they could make more money off of us, it had nothing to do with trying to make up for a horrible experience!!  I've had better treatment and more respect at a TGI Friday's!!!  And their so-called "best server" had still given us bad service by bringing the wrong food!   Given the overwhelmingly bad service of the evening, needless to say, we didn't leave a tip.  The sad part is that I really wanted to like this place.  After all, I'd heard really good things about it...but I would NEVER go to House of Prime Rib again, nor would I recommend it to anyone else!   If you want good beef, go some place that offers good service, great food, and respects their customer's reservation times, like Alfred's...but don't waste your time or money at HOPR!!!</review>

	<review>I went on Mother's Day with family and I was extremely disappointed with my meal. Long story short - it was totally unimpressive and quite ordinary. The House Cut was very tender but tasted like just a slab of meat and nothing more. The salad was excellent as usual but the main course was disappointing. Service was excellent, however.</review>

	<review>If you love Prime Rib, this is hands down, the best place to eat it. It's really quite cheap when you include the HUGE salad (I always leave some on my plate to make room for the oncoming beef), huge baked potato or mashed with gravy (yum), creamed spinach or creamed corn and some great yorkshire pudding. How can you not be happy with all of this??? The price is good. The ambience is great and there's always a wait and you rarely get sat at the time of your reservation because this place is GOOD (so watch the TV or drink at the bar -- it's quite cozy in there). They even remodelled their bathrooms (finally) and did a decent job of it.</review>

	<review>The prime rib here is awesome and for the price you pay, you get tons of food - bread, salad, corn bread, sides, and of course the prime rib.  The food is always reliably good but the service is a hit or miss depending on your server.  So I don't go here expecting much on service, but it's my place for a prime rib craving!</review>

	<review>I'm very sad to have to give this place 3 stars. I've probably been 7 times in the past 3 years, and yesterday was my first bad experience. but i just don't think a five star place should ever leave you with a bad memory. i made reservations for 4 at 7 pm, but we didn't get seated until 7:30. I can forgive that. What I can't forgive is the strange attitude that we received from our waiter. What I used to think was very cool about HOPR is that if you finish your cut you can ask for a small slice more (how original! right?) well, my brother and his girlfriend were able to finish theirs and were hesitantly given their extra slice. THEN, while they were still eating, our waiter (Michael) came by and told my brother's girlfriend, 'you can't take that home, just thought i'd let you know.' some people might think i'm overreacting, but it just felt completely unnecessary for him to tell her that, and i doubt he says it to every table he waits on. also, in the past when we went, if two people split an entree, each would get her own plate with mashed potatoes and spinach/corn. this time, it only came on one plate. maybe they are cutting costs, i don't know. Maybe he was having a bad day, maybe he thought that the four of us spending $130 on dinner was not a big enough check, maybe he just rubbed us the wrong way. anyhow, it was not a pleasant evening. the food is still delicious. that is what all 3 stars go toward. but because of one night and one waiter, a place that was one of my favorite restaurants in SF has vacated its place in my heart and opened up for another Friendlier place.</review>

	<review>Yes, the wait to get a table can be long, even with a reservation.  I like to think the reason behind this is that nobody wants to leave the table because the food is so good.  I highly suggest the English cut, which is thinner and very tasty.  The waiters here, are the cream of the crop.  If you wanted to become a professional waiter, a bit of a lost art form, this is where you should study.  The HOPR also has the best drink deals where you get a cocktail and a mini shaker with at least another cocktail inside, for a fair price.  An excellent meal at a fair price.</review>

	<review>This was by far the best place we could have went on Valentine's Day (which was also our one year anniversary). I had to make the reservation in November, and I'm glad I did. We arrived 30 minutes early and saw so many people waiting to try and get a table, but when 9 pm came, they promptly called our name and sat us. The food was exceptional! We both ordered the King Henry Cut (as recommended by many) and it did not disappoint. There was so much food! Bread, cornbread, salad, potatoes, corn, plus a big ol' slab of juicy, pink prime rib... Oh god.... Anyhoo, our waiter was very nice, the meat zepplin was amazing, and every woman received a rose, compliments of the House. I thought that was a really nice thing to do on V-Day! We left stuffed to the brim with delicious foods. I highly recommend using the valet parking. It was totally worth it. Think about it, San Francisco at night, trying to find parking.... JUST USE THE VALET! I'm the queen of cheapskates, but even I am telling you to do it! The best part of the night was when we were leaving, the owner came outside and I go over to shake his hand and thank him for a lovely night, he pulls me close and says "I do not shake hands with women..." and put out his cheek. Which promptly received a kiss from me. He was just so adorable! My boyfriend shook his hand and told him how much we enjoyed our night, and he thanked us for coming. It was so cheezy, but cute. This is a great special occasion place, we dressed up since it was our anniversary, but I noticed the younger people weren't quite as fancy. I would definitely come back in the future!</review>

	<review>Good place to go for it and indulge, but why the hell did they make my brother and I wait 40 minutes to be seated, WITH a reservation??!!  F***ers!  Plus, our meat was lukewarm... blah... I would rather go to Ruth's Chris across the street. I love prime rib, so I gave them the B.O.D. even when... -My parents also had a horrendous wait when they went last year.  I don't know why they stayed that long but they waited for friggin' 2 and a half hours. Sooooo.... -I made reservations for 9:00 for a party of 2, and we even showed up early at 8:40.  We got to our table at 9:fuckin' 40. My brother and I just kept watching in a stupor as huge-ass parties were being seated.  I went up to the host twice asking when we'd get a table.  I don't think it's about the host or whoever being racist... it's about getting the fat-ass gratuity off a big party.  So my suggestion is, don't go to HOPR if it's just you and a guest because they won't notice you, or will overlook you for a bigger party.   Grades for House of Prime Rib: -Parking: C; average in the city, valet is expected, not a lot of street parking obviously -Lobby/bar: C; stuffy and noisy, not a whole lot of place to go or move around when it's crowded; made me cranky as I watched others leave to sit at a nice table -Host(ess)/reservationist: F; liars and punks.  Yes they take reservations but they don't mean a thing. -Server: C; bland but nice enough.  The salad service is overrated.  It took a long time to get our drinks.  He didn't ask us how our meal was, didn't check in until the very end of the meal -Food: C; this particular time, the prime rib, the star of the show, was lukewarm... how awful... I think it was because we were getting the last of the ribs... I wanted to like this place so much after my dad said how he hated it.  (They ended up going to Joe's of Westlake that night, and had a much better experience than at HOPR, btw.)  It was his first time, and I feel like I let him down somehow because it was my suggestion.  Oh well... now I understand how he feels.   Sorry, won't give it another try.   P.S. After telling this horror story to co-workers, they suggested a couple of prime rib spots in Burlingame... will go there from now on, as a) it's not House of Prime Rib b) it's as good as HOPR c) it's closer to home</review>

	<review>I've dined at House of Prime Rib a number of times and have always enjoyed my meal to the fullest. The prime rib is delicious and the salad and creamed corn/spinach cannot be beat. It's not cheap (especially with wine, ha) but it's an awesome deal for all you get. The service is typically pretty good but I have waited more than half an hour on a reservation for a table (both times were with groups over 6). Normally, I'd knock a star for the delay but since I really enjoy the food and the service is better once you're seated... I'll keep it at 5 :D</review>

	<review>I visited the House of Prime Rib for a second time and was disappointed greatly with the service. We waited an hour for a 730 reservation we were on time for and when we asked about the wait we were put off twice with "They are paying the check and it will just be a few more minutes".  Finally a hostess offered us a free round of drinks or dessert in apology for the wait. At least she was straightforward about the situation. The Maitre d'e was not. Finally we got to eat and the food admittedly is very good. Initially our waitress was very friendly and helpful. However, when she found out about the free dessert her attitude changed and we had a long wait for our dessert. We also were charged for 4 glasses of wine which we did not order which I luckily caught before I paid the bill. The waitress seemed to doubt our word but took it off after I insisted. I am from Honolulu and was looking forward to eating there because the first experience was very good but I am not sure I would go there again.</review>

	<review>This place is not that great. Maybe one of the most overrated things in SF. The two stars are for the service, the owner, and thats where it stops. The food is really sloppy and diner esque, to be blunt. The noise level is that of a high school cafeteria, so don't go here if you're trying to take your lady out and whisper sweet nothings. Sure, the portions are on point, but the flavor is nowhere to found. Check it out for yourself, you might dig it, but for the price and decor  I can think of way better destinations in SF, East Bay, Peninsula , and beyond.</review>

	<review>Awesome prime rib, awesome service, awesome everything... I come here for my BF's annual holiday party and they have the room in the back to themselves.... Best Cosmopolitans in the entire world!! No Lie....but what a creeper!! I get secretly sooo wasted every year and try my hardest to hold conversation, but totally worth every damn sip... Since it's a pretty large party, you start off with a huge plate their house salad and their dressing is off the hook!!  then you choose how you want your steak cooked (Med. Rare), choose a side (creamed spinach), and potatoes (mashed please) and waiters come around and offer you spoon bread and if you want, some spicy horseradish sauce.... With my dinner, i move on to wine...and I never have room for dessert but i tried some of the fruit trifle....and omg, im in heaven.... But bottom line, what i come for is that fat-ass, medium rare, cut of prime rib and the best cosmos in the world....looking forward to next year.</review>

	<review>I've been to House of Prime Rib exactly twice.  One time too many.  Here's why: Husband and I came here about seven years ago during our "let's hit all the steakhouses in SF" streak.  Reservation was around 8 or 830, I don't remember precisely.  What I do remember, was that we weren't seated until 30 minutes after our reservation, and were pretty steaming mad.  We got comped a bottle of house wine (eh), but that soured the whole dining experience.   Ok, ok - maybe that was a fluke, right?  I shouldn't be so harsh.   Rewind to this past Saturday night.  Brother and his friends wanted to go here, and made reservations about two weeks in advance and could only get a 930pm slot for the 4 of us.  It's summer tourist season at House of Prime Rib, so fine.   Arrive at 9:25pm.  Host tells us we'll be seated in 20 to 25 minutes.  Um, wtf?  Is this the House of Prime Rib standard?  It's one thing to say you are running late and we'll be seated as soon as possible, and then unfortunately 20-25 minutes pass.  It's another thing for the host to state upfront that it'll be 20-25 minutes, like this is the Cheesecake Factory on a Saturday afternoon.  It's yet ANOTHER thing to say that when your reservation is at $#%@ 930pm!   STRIKE ONE. We get seated 35 minutes later. STRIKE TWO. When server brings salad to table on a tray,  there is a stack of used salad plates on her tray.  Are we at Denny's or something?  Couldn't she have dropped those off in the kitchen before tossing our salad and serving it to us alongside the dirty dishes?  For $40/person I expect an ATTEMPT to provide good, clean service.  STRIKE THREE. There were a couple more strikes but I don't want to exert any more brain power (what's left of it anyhow) on this place. kthxbai.</review>

	<review>I went here with my Fiance for my birthday. We got there and decided to wait for a booth so we headed over to the bar. We both ordered Martinis and to our surprise they left the shakers that had about 2 more martinis in each! When we got to the table our waiter greeted us right away and mainted excellent customer service throughout the whole meal. They have a great wine list and they are shockingly reasonably priced so we got a bottle to share. We each ordered our prime rib cuts which already come with salad (the dressing is fantastic) baked or mashed potatoes, creamed corn or spinach and yorkshire pudding. A ton of food and everything was delicious. It was a great restaurant experience and I will absolutely be going back!</review>

	<review>3.5 star nonplussed... Don't get me wrong.. group of folks + a bit of pre-partying + desire to moron up or make your version of Jersey Shore West + unquentionable desire for bloody meat and yorkshire pudding = party at the HOPR (rhymes with shopper). This CAN be a five star place if you have a large group and have pre-partied. I wouldn't recommend for a two person date night as the wine markup and selection is kind of beat, and the food doesn't wow for the price. Having said that I want to reemphasize that this place is absolutely stellar for larger groups. It's just like the restaurant you went to on prom night, never admit to taking a girl there, but you did have a good time.</review>

	<review>Let me just start by saying...I'm not typically a fan of prime rib. If I'm eating at a steakhouse, this is usually the last thing I choose. I do enjoy a nice slice of prime rib, maybe once a year. With that said. This place makes a mean prime rib. I have never in my life had a more perfectly cooked piece of meat. I asked for medium and I got EXACTLY that. Super tender, juicy, perfectly pink, I didn't even need my very cool House of Prime Rib knife. Very high quality meat...no tenderizer taste. My only complaint is that I didn't choose an end piece. As far as sides go, they are plentiful! Each slice of meaty deliciousness comes with your choice of either mashed or baked potato; creamed corn or spinach; and crispy dab o yorkshire pudding (a lovely puffed pancakey dough to sop up all the jus). Hubby and I chose opposite of one another so we could try everything. I personally liked the loaded baked potato and creamed spinach the best of the options. You also get to enjoy a round of sourdough and an "ear" of fresh baked cornbread if you choose to. Prior to going I had seen lots of reviews about the beet salad and how amazing it was. While I felt it was good, it wasn't spectacular. It's more a show to prepare it than anything else. All in all, a wonderful dining experience. Definitely a must if you like prime rib! I also understand that if you want seconds they will often give you a second slice of meat from the Meat Zepplin once your first slice is done for FREE!!! Now we were just waaaay too full to be able to handle that, I couldn't even finish my first slice, but for those of you who can handle your meat and then some...that will be the icing on the cake...or should I say the "extra jus" to your prime rib :)</review>

	<review>I had a wonderful dinner here for my birthday last Friday night! Nothing's really changed here, the prime rib is still the BEST. I got the city cut, which was the perfect amount! Baked potato, fully loaded, side of creamed spinach, side of sweet corn, &amp; a slice of the yorkshire pudding! I thought I'd died and gone to heaven! To top off the evening, they sang happy birthday to me (though they were singing every 5 mins, cuz everyone and their mama was celebrating a birthday that night!) My rasberry sorbet was delicious and a perfect cap on a perfect meal!!!</review>

	<review>Went here with family from L.A. for my birthday dinner....HOLY HELL, that was the best damn prime cut-o-cow I've ever had! You talk about a ton of food too! The salad is too delicious to go easy on, so if you know you're hungry enough to handle a full bowl of salad and then tackle that succulent half a heifer you're about to dig into, by all means do so! But seriously, if you're a vegetarian, you can still come here and fill up on that awesome salad with beets in it. Yes, you read me correctly, I encouraged veggies to go eat at the HOPR. Under one condition: you just try a bite. That's all you need to be hooked.</review>

	<review>Went to the House of Prime Rib for a family dinner recently. First of all, even if you made reservations, get there early and have a drink in the lounge.  We make 5:30 dinner times (at open), but the lounge usually opens an hour earlier.  The martini's are served with a shaker and plenty more inside for what might even be considered a second drink.  Three in our party had martini's, I had a margarita on the rocks.  All drinks were fantastic. We all ordered medium cuts of the prime rib dinner.  I don't know where other reviews are coming from, but the meat had plenty of flavor.  We didn't request, but still received the bone-in portion of the prime rib and the meat near the bone was flat out fantastic.  The sides were good as usual; cream spinach, mashed potatoes, yorkshire pudding, and the fantastic warm bread.  As usual, they offered up another couple of slices when you were down with the first. The service was great as usual.  A young woman was our server and she had the excellent ability to work quick but not hurry, and engage in the art of conversation with every member of our party.  She wasn't forced at all.  She was crisp, decisive, and while she zipped all over the place, we never felt rushed to get our meal done.  We did not have dessert. The ambiance is typical steakhouse.  It isn't loud per se, but everyone is talking and having a good time.  The restaurant is broken up into sections and the very front is definitely more noisy than other rooms.  If that really concerns you, ask for a quiet room during the reservation (that's a guess).   We are already planning our next trip.</review>

	<review>Good Food - Spotty Service This place is a good old fashioned stick to your ribs slabs o meat serving joint.  What I like about it: 1) Everything is included in the price - salad, sides, bread, etc.  None of this $32 for a steak, $10 for a quartered potato and $5 for bread (I won't mention any names, but Bobo's) - although those places have better steak.  But I digress. 2) The Prime Rib is yummy.  This is possibly the only place where I've had prime rib and not bemoaned the fact that I didn't get a rib eye (not that they offer those, but still). 3) The price - pretty good for all the stuff you get, plus I like that they mix the salad at your table - actually spinning the bowl as they pour the salad dressing in.  Pretty fun. What I don't like about this place: 1) Waited 20 minutes past a reservation time once.  Then we were crammed into a table that wasn't typically a table - a post against my back and the serving tray against my dining companion's.  Once I have an experience like that at a restaurant it takes a long time for me to overcome it (like years).  I fear HOPR for that reason (have returned twice since, 18 months ago, but I still have anxiety about it). 2)The place is always packed.  PACKED to the gills with families (all of whom seem to order the English Cut - also bizarre) with lots of cameras and birthdays - yes, it's true. 3) We had one or two GREAT wait persons there, a couple of indifferent ones and one really bad one - like I said above, it's spotty. Overall, a good deal for the money.  Make a reservation or be prepared to seat yourself at the bar for about 30 - 45 minutes.</review>

	<review>this is place serves the best prime rib in the country ( lowry's is pretty up there too). The meat is tender and the flavor  is perfect. I ordered the king henry cut the last two times I was there ( yes,, I'm 90 lbs but good steak ain't got nothing on me!).  you can actually order free seconds after your meal. Its a small thin slice, but nice to know that its an option. I wouldn't recommend the English cut if you like your meat rare or medium rare, when you pour the au jous over it, it cooks the whole thing. Their salad is also very good. Its the ONLY place where i will eat ALL my salad ( and want more). You can't do wrong with any of the desserts either, they are all very good. the only thing I think they can do better at is the creamed corn. get the creamed spinach or baked potato instead.</review>

	<review>There is only one thing on the menu here and it is meat!!! Um never mind they also have fish but who would ever order fish here. I ordered the English cut which came with small slices of meat, it's supposed to be tastier but i think the traditional cut is the best. Breading pudding is so awesome, it light and fluffy. The cream spinach is good but for some reason i thought it tasted better the last time I came here. Overall a good experience except that we had to wait super long even though we had reservations but we were about 20 minutes late.</review>

	<review>The only other nice prime rib restaurant I've been to is Lawry's, and first off, the decor here at HOPR is better. It's dimmer, more intimate, and looks more like a steakhouse. I came here with my girlfriend and 2 other friends on Saturday of Memorial Day Weekend at around 5:30 p.m. I didn't make reservations, so I knew there was going to be at least an hour long wait, so we grabbed 3 vodka tonics for $24. Ended up getting seated at around 7 p.m... not bad, I guess. I ordered the HOPR cut, well, served with mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. -Salad - I like the test at Lawry's a little better. The beets weren't as good and there were no croutons. -Prime Rib - on par with Lawry's -Yorkshire Pudding - Softer than Lawry's -Creamed Spinach - First time having it and I thought it was pretty good. The spinach was chopped up very fine so that the texture was almost like mashed potatoes. -Mashed Potatoes - Smooth consistency but not much flavor. -Creamed Corn - Tried some of my girlfriend's. Tastes way better at Lawry's. A lot of the kernels here were crushed and the flavor wasn't as bold or sweet. Service was a little slow, but that's to be expected on a busy weekend. We were also celebrating my friend's birthday, so he got a free 2 scoops of ice cream as well as a polaroid picture of the group in a HOPR paper frame. Price was about $50 a person, drinks not included. Overall, decent restaurant with good prime rib. I would come here again if I crave prime rib.  The ambiance is more personal than at Lawry's, but if you haven't tried Lawry's, you should definitely give it a shot. Even though creamed corn is a side dish, it's good enough at Lawry's to try at least once. Does not accept Discover Credit Card</review>

	<review>The vodka martini is probably one of the best if not the best I've ever had.  I rarely have a martini but this was smooth.  The hot fresh bread ( two varieties ), yorkshire pudding  and creamed spinach were delightful.  The baked potato was fine but it's not that difficult to make.  It was smothered with sour cream, bacon and probably some other toppings.  Alas the largest cut of prime rib -- the King Henry The Eighth  ( 16 ounces ) of medium rare prime rib was probably among the worst I have tasted.  Visually the beef looked medium rare but the taste was lacking.  The texture of the meat was not as tender as it should of been.  The quality just wasn't there.  One shouldn't have to chew this cut and expend that much energy.  I also found it lacking in fat that could be so enjoyable to consume.  All in all the drink and sides were memorable but the beef forgetable.</review>

	<review>If you want a heavy delicious meal come here! the portions are enormous. The atmosphere of the restaurant is absolutely classy. Our waiter for the night was hilarious. One witty comment after another. Desert was delicious too. I had the house tiramisu which was divine heaven in my mouth.  Great place to indulge in any celebration. Kind of pricey though.</review>

	<review>this is one of my all-time favorite restaurants in the city.  a friend once asked me what would happen if i was taken here on a first date?  without any hesitation, i said sex on the first date regardless of the boy.  that's how much i HEART HoPR.   do not go crazy and eat tons of the sourdough bread or cornbread.  that will only take up valuable stomach space.  total rookie mistake. the salad is delicious and i don't even like 1000 island dressing.  the chilled fork to go with your salad is key.  then there's all the yumminess of the prime rib. i never liked prime rib until i came here.  its just so tender, juicy and delicious.  then the creamed spinach or corn are both delicious.  plus the Yorkshire pudding and the baked potato or mashed.  AMAZING.  i cant rave enough about this place.  and the 2nd free slice comes with accompanying sides.  its about $35 per person and for all that quality food, that's a steal!!</review>

	<review>Let's keep it real here. If you don't know much about beef, specifically the finer specifics about beef, and you think Outback is the best steakhouse in the world then this is the place for you! I'm serious and I'm not being condescending here. It's a good next step up into the world of beef and is priced accordingly. But know that it is definitely not the best prime rib joint "ever". Keep it humble and in perspective. For those who love steaks and roasts, there are better places than this in the city. It was a bit bland and lacked the amount of tenderness that I desire from a nicely dry aged prime rib. This place is not for you unless you just want to experience this well known SF "experience". I'm not knocking you if you do decide to visit regardless because I did too and I didn't regret it. I just wouldn't come back if given the choice.</review>

	<review>I asked for my prime rib well done (I know - blasphemy!) but I don't like bloody beef... what I got was the burnt shavings off the butt of the meat.  It was actually pretty funny (I got what I asked for) and it made me leave room for dessert which I usually don't have room for. While I didn't like the prime rib, the service and ambience were enjoyable and I if I do return, I might try it medium as my friends all seemed to enjoyed their pink prime rib.</review>

	<review>I've been going to House of Prime Rib for a long time now and usually it's pretty good but not in the last visit.  Food was good as usual but the service was lackluster.  It took forever for the sourdough bread to arrive and the cornbread guy provided cornbread to everyone in the room but skipped us.  When I got up to ask him about it, he just shrugged and said that he was all out and walked away.  The server also seemed bored and not very attentive. But at least the food was up to the usual standard.  A hearty serving of very good prime rib, beet salad, creamed spinach or corn, mashed or baked potato, and Yorkshire pudding.  It's not the best that I've had (I think Alexander's would have to take that title) but it's a great value for the cost.   The verdict is four stars for the food/value and two stars for the service so that averages out to the three star rating.</review>

	<review>Came here after the Ghirardelli Chocolate Festival for a late lunch/early dinner. Given a 4:30pm reservation on a Sunday evening, it wasn't too crowded, but definitely more people than I would have expected! The ambiance of the restaurant is classy, medium to low light settings, mural wall paintings. Given the decorations, people were dressed from casual (me and my party) to classy (prom kids). (For comparison because the s.o. is a Lawry's fan, I have to mention that Lawry's has a nice meatball and chip appetizer while waiting for your table.) Menu is simple enough: you choose your cut of beef, spinach or corn, mashed or baked potato. The dinner also comes with a salad, yorkshire pudding and bread. For those who don't know, yorkshire pudding, is not at all like a pudding. It's a thin bread, made solely for the purpose of soaking up the meat gravy/juices. They make the salad in front of you, which was delightlyfully tasty and cold.  The chefs might have been having an off day with the creamed corn as it was not nearly as yummy as it could have been. But the creamed spinach was delicious, yorkshire pudding yummy and a loaded baked potato which was pretty bomb (they also dress the potato in front of you). Prime rib was delicious. Sadly, I remember Lawry's prime rib being SLIGHTLY and only slightly better. It could have been that I got a medium cooked cut instead of my normal medium rare, but even so... If you choose to share a meal with a partner, you can choose to do so at a cost of $7. Given the King Cut, this was more than plenty for the s.o. and I. When in the mood for Prime Rib and you are not in Nor Nor Cal or SoCal, House of Prime Rib is an excellent substitute. (I myself am HUGE fan of Cattlemen's Prime Rib in NorCal for its excellent cheaper price without sacrifice of quality and taste).</review>

	<review>This is one of the best places to get a Prime Rib and the prices are not that expensive.  The best deal you can get from their menu is their "Prime Rib A La Carte" at $29.95; which your prime rib will include creamed spinach, your choice of potato and Yorkshire pudding.  If you want a larger cut, you won't be able to get the A La Carte price; but it will include a salad that's really good, but is it worth an extra $5+?  It depends on how much you want to splurge on yourself or your date. The three times that I've been here, the ambiance noise was on the higher level, so it's not that easy to hold a conversation from across your table.  F.Y.I., if you completely finish your whole slab of prime rib, they will give you another slice on the house; but it will be a very thin slice.</review>

	<review>There are two types of diners: those that consider House of Prime Rib a good restaurant, and those that don't. I find myself firmly, and rather disappointingly, in the latter group. I say disappointingly, because I honestly thought I was in for something special, but what I got was a gimmicky, overpriced and bland meal where the emphasis is on filling you up rather than providing quality. The starter salad would be better described as a lettuce soup. The waiter brought out a salad bowl on ice, and proceeded to spin it while decanting a half-gallon of dressing over it from a great height. He then handed me a chilled (for some reason) salad fork on a small platter with which to eat it. Cute, but it doesn't make up for the soggy plate of leaves in front of me. The sides were about what you would expect from Applebee's, with a gargantuan dry old baked potato with mountains of sour cream, bacon bits and other stuff slopped on, and merely passable cream spinach. Most importantly, the steak had issues. There was a great knotty dark brown patch in the middle, mealy in texture and musty in taste. It was all a little off putting. Despite our better judgment we ordered a crème brulee for desert, which again had all the delicacy and flavor of a supermarket frozen pudding. Add a couple of glasses of wine each and we ended up paying $100 a head. I don't think this is really acceptable. If you're in the neighborhood and in the mood for a large slab of cow, head to Tommy's Joint on Van Ness. Otherwise, Ruth's Chris is about the same price and a damn site better. I should add that the service was very good and our waiter did everything he could to make sure we were well taken care of.</review>

	<review>Went here for my bday.  The salad was very good, and the meat was amazing!  (I think I just got the normal cut).  Never had yorkshire pudding before, but I liked it.   The other sides - mashed potatoes, creamed corn, creamed spinach - were definitely below average for a nicer restaurant like this(like boston market quality), but I had no room for the sides b/c after taking one juicy bite of my prime rib I knew that was all I was going to eat.   Eat here if you love prime rib.</review>

	<review>Quick warning - this is not the place to take vegetarians or people who do not eat red meat.  Ok, you've been warned! What can I say, almost everything here tastes like meat! Salad dressing tastes like meat (I wasn't a big salad person at the time, but I actually liked their salad!), creamed spinach tastes like bacon...can't say too much about the mashed potatoes since I don't really like them in general (I heard it tastes like meat too though).  I guess you can't really make yorkshire pudding taste meaty, but it does after it soaks up some of that meat-juice! But of course the star of the show, the prime rib was fabulous.  I don't think I've ever eaten here with anyone who did not order the prime rib, since that's what people go here for.  I always get the English cut which is one of the smallest cuts you can get, but I really like the thin slices 'cause it soaks up more of the juice.  I gotta say this place has one of the best beef dishes I've ever had, and definitely the best   prime rib dishes I've ever had.  Yum!  I'm usually full after one serving, but they give out seconds if you're still hungry (I heard they stop giving thirds, etc. though). Comparison with Lawry's: I've seen a lot of people compare this to Lawry's.  I've been here once 4-5 years years ago, then went to Lawry's (in Beverly Hills), then went back here last year.  I gotta say, both when I was in Lawry's and the second time I've been here, I've found House of Prime Rib to be much better.  Lawry's seems to over-season theirs, while HOPR keeps more of the beefy flavor.  Also, HOPR has much better sides. Best place hands down to bring a beef lover in the Bay Area.</review>

	<review>oh my this is quite the place for an experiential dinner. The entire meal from the first bite of bread and butter to the last bite of prime rib is orchestrated to perfection. To begin the journey of this review, the menu. The menu is quite simple, with 4 different sized cuts of prime rib to cater to your appetite level. There are children's menu items, additional sides, as well as fish, but the real star is the prime rib, of course. Onto the prime rib. I ordered the City Cut, the smallest cut. For a girl though, it was PLENTY, when you take into account that whichever cut you do order comes with an appetizer salad first, and then mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, and Yorkshire pudding alongside the prime rib. Before the prime rib arrived, they present a full round loaf of bread with butter, about 6 inches in diameter. The bread had a tough, crisp crust with a soft inside. Nothing too crazy, but a nice starter. Onto the salad. Now, I'm not a huge salad person (personally I find it to be a bit too boring). But here, they have a waiter/waitress freshly toss and prepare the salad right in front of you in a large bowl. The salad is simple, iceberg lettuce, red onions, and this fantastic light and creamy dressing to pull the salad together. Topped with fresh ground pepper, this salad was a great start to what would be a fantastic meal. The salad is huge, mind you. It's not a dinky side salad that's eaten in 2 bites. It's a good portion that really gets your stomach ready for the prime rib to come. Finally the piece de resistance arrives. The carving cart comes by, and the server cuts each of our ordered cuts right in front of us, pours a nice waterfall of jus on top, adds a good helping of mashed creamy mashed potatoes and horseradish sauce, and finishes the plate off with creamed spinach. Next, another waiter comes by with fresh Yorkshire pudding. We each got a half of a 6 inch round of Yorkshire pudding. I'd say I have my work cut out for me. The meat was tender and moist, and tasted wonderful paired with the creamy mashed potatoes. I'm not a big fan of spinach, so I stayed away from the creamed spinach--but nothing bad to say about it. The Yorkshire pudding was alright,  it tastes a bit like a slightly chewy, moist sweet bread. Near the end of the meal I was already struggling to finish my cut (the smallest cut). Also, keep in mind you can get an extra thin cut of prime rib for free after you eat your cut, so my recommendation would be, if you're thinking of getting 1 or 2 cuts larger, to just order one cut smaller and ask for the extra thin cut at the end. Steph's Recommendation(s): I'd just get the fish. Just kidding--The City Cut was just perfect! :)</review>

	<review>If you love prime rib, they have the best!  Reservations are a must as they will reserve the whole restaurant and not leave any seats for walk-ins.  If you walk in, be prepared for an hour or more wait.   The food is very tasty and prepared just the way you would want.  Their meals include Yorkshire pudding, baked potato and salad with their fantastic dressing.   The best thing is if you finish your initial serving, 2nd's are on the house (as well as 3rd's if you have the space).   It's hard to go wrong with "The House"!</review>

	<review>prime rib is good but not the best, price is comparable to other prime rib places in the area, it will cost you pretty penny if this is for a first date, no real frills, place to go with group of friends or date, service is good, quality prime rib can't complain, dark like most steakhouses, kinda tight quarters, ehh just an ok in my book.</review>

	<review>Okay, so I'm a carnivore. I admit, I love my meat, especially prime rib. We got there on time, yet we had to wait. Half an hour, we were told, but we knew it'd be longer. So, of course, we hit the bar for a drink before our meal. I ordered a lemon drop martini, which was strong and delicious, and the bartender gave me another shaker of the martini enough for at least 5 more drinks. It was strange, yet graciously accepted. As my stomach started to rumble in hunger, we were finally called to be seated. They started us off with piping hot sourdough bread and butter. Right there, I knew it'd be a good night. But I was stopped from eating too much bread by my oh so delightful dining companion because it would fill me up. I was sad. Then we were given our salad, which was a lighter version of the ceasar. Delicious. Finally, our nice, juicy cuts of prime rib were served in front of us with creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. I was glad that I didn't eat all the bread, because I couldnt even finish my cut of prime rib. (They'll give you a second cut if you finish your first!) Just lovely. Wonderful night in SF with great company and delicious food. What more can a girl ask for?</review>

	<review>I've driven by this for years, and had heard numerous raving reviews but had never taken the opportunity to pay a visit until now. I was absolutely not disappointed. It took awhile for us to be seated (even at 9pm) but it was well worth the wait. Service was great and food was even better. It reminded me of Lawry's in LA. I'd still prefer a big streak over prime rib, but I'll definitely be visiting again.</review>

	<review>Thank you baby Jesus. I've died and gone to Heaven. I very rarely give out 5 stars for a restaurant, but couldn't wait to return to a computer near me to proudly dish out the five for House of Prime Rib. Against better judgment, knowing I'd have quite a meal ahead of myself; I started off with a French martini [served in a personal shaker: providing just about 2 cocktails]. Next up, a small warm loaf of sourdough with delicious salty butter was brought to our table.  I knew I was in for a treat.   Cornbread shaped from a corn tin was brought to our table next along with a delicious iceberg / romaine salad with julienned beets, chopped hard-boiled eggs, tomatoes and crotons in a sherry vinaigrette.  The salad was brought out in a silver bowl in a clear bowl filled with ice. The chilled salad was then spun by the waiter [in our case, Jason: AWESOME] and sprinkled with a few cracks of pepper and salt:  Same with the dressing. The salad was tossed. [Insert inappropriate joke here, if you must]  We both received a very full plate of salad... I can't recall the last time I was this excited about eating a salad. We both our ordered the House cut medium rare, creamed spinach and baked potatoes.  The baked potatoes were dressed in front of us and to our liking.   Sour Cream, Butter, and Chives and yes... Bacon. We got hooked up with extra bacon because I had mentioned to my boyfriend, "ooh  Bacon- you make my daaaay" and Jason [our waiter] said, "Would you like some more bacon?" I graciously responded with, "absolutely." He retorted with something to the effect, "don't be shy, we want you to be happy!" And happy I was.   He then brought the Yorkshire pudding out. Don't be confused, there's nothing Bill Cosby about this.  It's more like bread that's a bit moist in the middle. I highly recommend a) trying it and b) soaking the prime rib juices in it. The prime rib; il est magnifique. I had the hot horseradish on the side, but totally unnecessary. I doubt you'll have room for another piece, which they offer [not to go, but to eat] gratis.  This is doubly true for dessert - you simply won't have room. Service was terrific.  It wasn't one of those places where you go and you're bothered too frequently or not assisted enough. It was just right . And you can't beat the atmosphere.  Think Original Joe's meets your Uncle's place; it sort of has a mob feel to it, but cozy. Note: Make reservations well in advance and request a booth if there's just two of you. All in all, it was an excellent experience and I will certainly be returning.</review>

	<review>All right, all right. After living in the city for some 15 years now, I FINALLY made it out to the House of Prime Rib with some out of town visitors. For some reason I just never came out to see what the hub bub was all about. Well, now I am a believer! My guests and I decided to check this place out after a great day of seeing the city on Thursday evening. We called that day for reservations as there were 6 of us. Walking in, it seemed like one of those very, very old establishments with old school vibe. The menu was very simple: how big do you want your prime rib and do you want a baked potato or mashed potato with that? Everything else you get with it, from salad, to yorkshire pudding. Everything was in HUGE proportions. The salad was amazing, and the dressing definitely made it. It's too bad i couldn't eat most of it, cause i knew i wouldn't be able to eat anything else if i did. The prime rib was cooked to perfection, so buttery and rare, just like i ordered it. The spinach and baked potato was okay, and i never did get my yorkshire pudding. But i didn't care. With the amount of food I got, i was ready to go home and pass out. The service was good and patient (especially since we were a loud table). And the price wasn't that bad. And I would highly recommend this place.</review>

	<review>I am not a huge beef fan.  Other than Hambergers I dont' really eat it.  The prime rib at House of Primb Rib is an exception.   First you get their salad, which is tossed right in front of you.  This salad is TO DIE FOR.   Then the prime rib comes out and they carve it right in front of you.  I prefer the english cut, which is the thinnest cut.  The prime rib absolutely melts in your mouth.  It is so tender and immaculate I almost orgasm everytime I swallow it. The primb rib is accompanied by your choice of mashed potatoe or baked potatoe.  I prefer the mashed potatoe.  It also comes with delicious cream of spinach.  The combination of it all is a dream come true. The House of Prime Rib is my favorite restaurant in S.F. by far.  Try it.  Be sure to make a reservation though.  It's not one of those places that you can just pop in and be promtly seated.</review>

	<review>RUDE RUDE RUDE wait staff!!! I hate this place and all it stands for! Unbelievably rude!  I wish I could give negative stars.  Just because this place is hustling and bustling and is always packed, does not give you the right to treat your customers disrespectfully! Period. Here is what I call the worst restaurant experience in my ENTIRE LIFE!!! We arrive on time, but of course it's one of those places that never have the table ready as it should. Every time I have come here, the wait has been over 45 minutes past our reservation time, but the second they call your name and you don't hear it, they give the table away! We wait in the waiting area, grabbing a glass of wine. A waitress walks by with one of those huge "House of Prime Rib" custom knives (if you've been here, you would know that these are almost like cleavers!) She walks right past me and misses me by inches. Ok, I was freaked out, but I'm sure it was an accident, right. Then she proceeds to stand in front of a child with the knife pointed inches from his face, as he blankly stares at the knife. I walk up to her and say, "excuse me miss, please be a careful you might accidentally hurt someone."  She flashes me the dirtiest look and starts huffing "EXCUSE ME? I don't think so" as she storms off to her manager with the necktie. I see her talking to him and pointing directly at me. So I walk on over to hear her say, "that lady is extremely angry and claiming that I'm going to 'STAB' someone with a knife" STAB??!!! what the? I never said stab! I calmly said it to her to be more cautious with the knife. So I thought the manager would take my side, after all I am the customer. I was furiously wrong! He snapped at me and told me to just go to my table, we'll take care of you.  Take care, my arse! They didn't do anything but give me a well done piece of prime rib when I asked for medium rare. By that time, I was so exhausted to dispute the overcooked tough dinner. My final words, this place is not what it's all cracked up to be.  Instead, go to Broadway Prime in Burlingame, where the wait staff is fabulously friendly and the Prime Rib is so much better and cooked to your liking. It is worth the drive to to deal with the jerks at House of Prime Rib!</review>

	<review>I give this place five stars, and would add a few more if I could. I m not a big fan of meat, or steaks. But this was absolutely one of the best places I ate at in the city. I have heard friends raving about it, and read several great reviews. So we finally caught ourselves on a super starving day and decided to give it a try. We had no reservations, just came in put our names in, they told us about half an hour, the restaurant was packed. So we decided to start at the bar, ordered two jack manhattan's very good, but not my choice of drink so i will probably never have it again. Twenty minutes later we were seated...wow!!! They took us into this room somewhere in the back, anywho it was sooo nice. Our server approached us soon after we were seated, saw that we are having cocktails, double checked if we were gonna do wine, and explained the menu... very helpful. We were then served a whole loaf of sour dough, yumm it was warm and so fresh, I am not sure if they bake it themselves, but it was delish.... I ordered the smallest portion of the prime rib, with those delicate mashed potatoes with sour cream and chives ( i don't do bacon, but thats an option), and yummy cream spinach... I still dream of this meal. My boyfriend had the medium sized portion also with the same sides. The started out with this amazing salad that melts in your mouth. The serving of the salad was so cool, our waitress came out with her bowl on ice filled with our salad and all ingredients, she then spun the bowl, and poured in dressed, and seasoning.... yummmm.... we were pretty much kinda stuffed when our meal arrived. But every bite of it was amazing..... I am only still wondering if they serve child size portions there for adults. j/k... Highly recommend this place. Upon our second visit to heaven... we tried a different technique this time... we ordered the biggest cut and shared... my disappointment was yet again, that I was astonishingly full... ( this is a good thing)!!! I begged for the childrens portion but they made me do it again... my second review is just to say that upon my second visit I was still impressed!!! Thanks House of Prime Rib for making me extremely full upon all my visits...he he</review>

	<review>We came here tonight for our 12 yr. anniversary.  We got seated promptly with a 6:30 reservation.  We had to make the reservation 2 weeks in advance.  The first thing I noticed was that it wasn't as intimate as any other fancy restaurant such as Alexanders.  The room we were seated in was loud and very crowded.  We got a small table on the corner, which was fine.  However, there was very little room to move around, especially when our server was making our salad, and people wanted to walk by him. I got the house cut and my husband got the english cut.  My first bite into the piece was a bit salty, but I added some horseradish to it, and it evened out the taste a bit.  I asked for plain spinach instead of the creamed spinach, and our waiter was happy to bring that out for me.  He also added some asparagus for me too.  I was a happy camper.  My husband didn't finish his dish because he said most of the pieces were very fatty and too rich for him.  The english cut is 3 thin slices, similar to the house cut.  They brought out warm sourdough bread, and anyone that knows me knows I love bread! All in all, it was a good experience.  We got free gelato for our anniversary and a free picture which was nice.  Definitely should try this place at least once, but I'm not sure I would go back to SF just for prime rib.  There are too many hidden gems out there to try!</review>

	<review>Wow, see previous rating from me as excellent...this last time I went has encouraged me to NEVER RETURN TO THIS SHIT-HOLE MASQUERADING AS A HIGH-CLASS ESTABLISHMENT! My meat was not cooked right, tasted funny, and our asshole server gave me a hard time for taking it back. you are never supposed to treat customers that way. should i pay $50 for a bad piece of meat? hellz no, and definitely not on my birthday. our server had a piss-pour attitude and the meat just did not have the texture and consistency that I have come to expect when eating steak. i will NOT return here. Thanks for ruining my birthday, douchebags!</review>

	<review>Where do I start? This restaurant is heaven. This place is always packed and you have to make a reservation if you plan on eating here. Even expect a wait for your table with a reservation. Once you sit down and order it begins: the salad is dressed table side and it is the best salad I have ever had. I always order the cut below the King cut and I get it rare. A King cut seems to be too much and the taste is not as concentrated. The cream spinach is a must as well. I recommend the baked potato since the mashed potatoes are put on your plate with the spinach and meat. It seems crowded and things mix together this way. I would imagine you could have the mashed potatoes put on a side dish if you requested. The yorkshire pudding is amazing especially after it has soaked up some of the meat juices. This place is a must visit if you are a meat lover. They have valet parking that is only $8 and you don't have to fish the money out till after your meal. Their Cosmos are very good as well.</review>

	<review>salad....GOOD....bread.....GOOD....meat....GOOD...­.dessert....GOOD. the service there is good too. I always leave this place happy and full.  I also enjoy the atmosphere and the service always seems good.  The waiters are polite and efficient.  I've been there many times over the years and, yeah sometimes you have to wait a while even though you have a reservation, but I think it's worth the wait.  I don't even like meat that much, but this place I can rely on for tasty, satisfying food.</review>

	<review>hmmm HOPR well what can I say.  It's an interesting experience...especially when you get the King Henry cut.  I can't say I wasn't satisfied after eating here...but honestly I didn't think the food was that great.  Prefer places like Lowry's for Prime Rib or places like Harris Ranch where the meat just seems to have more flavor. Oh a little advice...go light on the salad no matter HOW HUNGRY you are.  You'll thank me later...</review>

	<review>"English cut, rare. Mashed potatoes and creamed spinach please." I have only deviated once or twice from my usual, opting to try the baked potato once, which was mighty packed with sour cream, chives, bacon bits, and cheese, and overall mighty delicious.  Unfortunately I haven't tried the creamed corn, but will the next time I visit HOPR.  The salad here is also one of the best, and I dare say, it's all in the dressing. The corn bread man usually visits every table with his basket of warm, sweet, corn-mealy corn bread, but if he happens to pass you, just flag him down.  The service here is top-notch fabulous - friendly servers who cater to you. I haven't ever been able to go for the second helping, and I eat a lot.  I mean I eat so much people call me "Fatty."  Have tasted their desserts and they're quite good, but don't get the bread pudding.  For such a classy establishment, the bread pudding is pretty disappointing.</review>

	<review>The last time I've been here was about 3 years ago. This past weekend my gf and I had dinner here for our anniversary. I had many thoughts of this place from the first time I came here. I remember the salad was amazing and the King cut was so juicy and flavorable. Our service was excellent. When we checked in they asked if they can take our bottle of wine and set it on our table. We were seated and greeted by our host Cara. She made us feel at home. We told her that we were celebrating our anniversary. After we ordered our food we started drinkinga and enjoying ourselves and the atmosphere. So when the salad and prime rib came and gone our server gave us ice cream with two candles. To me I think that was ko0l. She actually listened to us and she cared about what was going on. To me I think going to a restuarant like this and enjoying yourselves, you have to have a server that makes you feel good after a good meal. So all in all my second time here was a memorable one. I look forward to coming here again. To eat a amazing salad and eat "The Best Prime Rib Eva". And the service was a 10-FURR</review>

	<review>Remember that nursery rhyme from childhood about loose BMs? When you're sliding into first and you feel a mighty burst, diarrhea *clap clap* diarrhea *clap clap* Well, I've composed a similar one in honor of this place. When the House of Prime Rib makes you smell like a baby's crib, diarrhea *clap clap* diarrhea *clap clap* When you order medium rare and the cook says, "I don't care!" diarrhea *clap clap* diarrhea *clap clap* And the salad's  really tasty, but it has--yikes--MSG! diarrhea *clap clap* diarrhea *clap clap* In all seriousness here, initially I was more worried about the environment than the food, given some of the comments about racist treatment towards Asians on yelp.  But I was wrong...the truth is actually the reverse.  It's a nice place and despite the place being packed we were seated only 10 minutes after our reservation.  Our waitress was very nice and apologetic when she couldn't get to us fast enough. But what about the food? Bread -- nothing special but not bad Salad -- The salad had good taste BUT the "table salt" that they put on it has MSG in it.  Just check the bottle!  And the lettuce...my goodness, it was like lettuce out of a bag of prepackaged salad from the grocery store. Prime rib -- Now look, if you only serve one dish and place that dish in the name of the restaurant, it better be dangnabit good.  Honestly, I didn't think my steak tasted any better than Outback Steakhouse.  Don't get me wrong, it was not bad, but it didn't taste like a $37 steak.  And it's definitely no Alexanders. The King Henry cut I got was only slightly bigger than my wife's regular cut and despite ordering medium rare, much of my steak was bloodier than a cat fight between 2 girls fighting over whether NYSNC or the Backstreet Boys were the better singers. The horseradish was pretty good. Sides -- Creamed corn was good and the baked potato was excellent. I would've given this place 3 stars because of thenice ambience and steak that tasted no better than Outback Steakhouse, but because I had 48 hours of nausea and diarrhea from their food I'm giving this place with one star and I'm wishing fire and brimstone upon the chef!</review>

	<review>I think you come here to be part of San Francisco culinary history.  It's one of those places that you have to try at least once.  The restaurant has been here longer than most people have been alive.   Love the salad, and the house dressing.  This salad got me eating beets... and I don't even like beets! Creamed spinach.... yum-mo Baked potato with everything, extra bacon- leave this for lunch tomorrow, otherwise you can't finish the prime rib English cut- I love the thinner cut because it soaks up more au jus, plus, if you want more meat, they will carve it for you right by the table. Definite food coma every time I walk out  of here</review>

	<review>Do I love the Prime Rib here?  YES!!  Are the servers quick and on target?  YES!! However, this is a well-known SF restaurant that is well aware that it isn't going anywhere so they do not treat their customers as they should.  I've eaten here approximately 7-10 times in my life and every time I have the same problems...which by the way, is NEVER the food or the servers!   I always make reservations via open table and I always arrive 5-10 minutes early and every single time we have to wait for long periods of time with no where to sit unless seats open up in the bar or small bar/lounge area which is filled with other folks waiting as well.  The least amount of time I've had to wait for my table past my reservation time is 35 minutes.  The most I've waited was 2.5 hours and they have NO REMORSE WHATSOEVER!   If you don't like it, go somewhere else....they could care less.  The same host has been there for quite some time...blonde man, huge pupils....if ya know what I mean?  He's rude.  Unfortunately for me, I have a person in my life that likes to visit this restaurant once a year...so I go and I deal with it but if it were up to me....screw The HOPR....I can find much better food all over SF.</review>

	<review>House of Prime Rib is a San Francisco institution.  It's fun to come here with a large group of people, but be prepared to shout in order to hear yourself.   Food:  3 stars.  Be prepared to eat a lot of food.  The prime rib comes in different cuts, but I went for the standard - the House of Prime Rib cut.  Accompanying the prime rib is the salad bowl, a choice between mashed or baked potatoes, creamed spinach or corn, and yorkshire pudding.  The first thing out is the salad bowl, a mixture of seasonal greens prepared tableside with house dressing that is similar to thousand island.  There's nothing special about the salad itself, so feel free to eat a few bites to stave off the hunger pangs and wait for the better part of the meal.  Next is the prime rib itself, along with the accompaniments.  The prime rib is decent, but it's harder to enjoy when I have had better (my dad's).  I can still appreciate the quality of the meat, however.  If you finish that piece, you can get a second cut that is more thinly sliced - I thought that one was more flavorful, so I'll be sure to order the English Cut next time I'm here.  As for the sides, the yorkshire pudding, corn and mashed potatoes are all good, but are trumped by the creamed spinach, yum!  As for the desserts, I had to try the English trifle, which I thought was good, but a bit ordinary (anyone can make this).   Service:  3 stars.  I imagine a lot of tourists come here because the servers ooze a lot of cheesy charm, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Since the menu is so simplistic, I would expect the servers to know the menu inside out, but our server had to check with the kitchen on whether certain menu items were appropriate for someone with food allergies at my table.  Also, when serving the prime rib, some of the accompaniments did not arrive at the same time.   Atmosphere:  4 stars.  The five-room restaurant looks like a traditional English tavern.  The dark wood and fireplaces lend some warmth and coziness to the atmosphere and the large stainless steel meat carts are a sight to see.  The crowd is mixed, but expect to see tourists and families. Hits:   Prime rib (second slice), creamed spinach, good value. Misses:  Extremely noisy. If You Like This Place, You'd Probably Like:  Broadway Prime, Harris' Restaurant, Houston's.</review>

	<review>favorite restaurant EVER. Where else can you get delicious prime rib and all of the sides for less than $45??? The place is a traditional restaurant, no new wave trends or anything. just good food and good service. There have been times where the service is better than others, but if you say something they definitely listen. I complained once about having food from my party packaged and the doggy bag sitting on our table before i had even finished my dinner (i explained feeling like i was being rushed), and when i dined there a couple months later, the maitre d came to me during dinner and asked if everything was ok, because he understood there was an incident the last time. I was pleasantly surprised that they had taken note and tried to make sure everything went smoothly the next time i came in. Aside from the food, that's what i love about this place, it's just a classic restaurant that tries to do right by the customer. Be sure to make reservations in advanced though (esp if you want one during a prime dining time, because they do fill up!). If you're a first timer, get the house of prime rib cut medium (try the spicy horseradish), with a loaded baked potato, and creamed corn. For dessert, the tiramisu.</review>

	<review>House of Prime Rib is the perfect restaurant to celebrate a special occasion!  But be warned, your celebration can take up to 3 hours! I recently ate here on a Sunday night with my boyfriend to celebrate our two year anniversary.  Taking the advice of previous yelpers, I called a few days ahead to make reservations.  They offer a valet service, which is great, because it is extremely to find parking nearby. The second we stepped in we joined the mass of people waiting to be seated.  Now this was 7:30 on a Sunday night and it was more packed than a can of sardines!  We finally maneuvered our way to the hostess who suggested we sit by the bar and wait for our names to be called.  So, I thought reservations meant that the restaurant saved a table for you and seated you at your reserved time.  Clearly I need a new dictionary because this was NOT my experience.  We had to wait close to 30 minutes before we were finally seated!  My boyfriend spoke to the hostess twice asking what the hold up was when we clearly had reservations.  Both times she just responded that there were people ahead of us on the "list."  No matter what the reason, our reservations seemed pointless. (Minus one star) Once we were finally seated, we were granted with the best waiter!  He asked us if we were celebrating anything and we told him it was our anniversary.  He went above and beyond to give us a really special night.  It was nice to get a waiter who actually made conversation with their guests as opposed to the "here's your food" waiter that is such the norm.  He brought us extra au jus, extra horseradish, added two candles on our dessert, and took a picture of us using the official "House of Prime Rib" polaroid.  He truly helped to make dinner special.   However, this was the LONGEST dining experience of my life.  We seriously were there from 7:30-10:30.  While our waiter's personality was awesome, the service was SOOOO SLOW! We didn't have to wait long for our salads to come, but we seriously waited close to an hour for our entree.  Our waiter informed us that the carving station was pretty backed up with tables, but seriously, waiting 45 minutes for a piece of prime rib is ridiculous.  My solution, get another carver!  The waiter did continually apologize for the long wait for our meat, but apology or not, waiting is NOT fun. (minus another star) At least, the food (once we got it) was amazing.  It was the best cut of prime rib I've had in a long time.  It was the perfect hint of pink and extremely easy to cut.  The creamed spinach includes bacon, so it is practically heaven.  We both had the baked potato which was STUFFED with the goods.  I'm talking gobs of butter, heaps of sour cream, and tons of bacon!  It's all so amazing, as long as you don't think about the calories.  For dessert we had the creme brulee which was prepared perfectly.  But, the two candles really added the romantic touch. I would love to go back here, but I'm not sure if it's worth the wait.</review>

	<review>I give it three stars. First off, be clear: They only have Prime Rib, and a fish dish, as a selection. Be prepared to spend about $40 a person without any drinks. The bread is excellent, and fresh baked right there. The salad was unimpressive, considering they "make it" right there at your table. A real high class restaurant will make a Caesar salad from scratch at your table, they merely add salt, pepper and the dressing at your table while spinning the METAL bowl in a glass bowl with ice. Caesar salad is traditionally made in a WOODEN bowl which has been rubbed with garlic, but I digress: Either the lettuce was unfresh, or I couldn't tell because they drowned it in dressing. They were overly pretentious by giving out chilled salad forks, which aside from impressing the tourists, really doesn't improve the salad eating experience. The meat was good, I will give them that, and perfectly cooked. I had it medium rare and I think I could have gone as low as full rare and still enjoyed it. The sides were all mediocre. I personally didn't like the creamed spinach, the Yorkshire pudding was just "ok" and a baked potato is a baked potato. Service was also mediocre, and we were seated 30-40 minutes after our reservation. The place was packed though, and we did get a nice table near the fireplace. And and all it was a pleasant dining experience, but I likely would not go back or recommend it. We were 2 guys and 3 ladies, and all the girls ate maybe half of their prime rib and they had the smallest cut. A little more diversity on the menu, and perhaps a more authentic caesar salad experience would have been nice.</review>

	<review>Well what else is there to say about this place?  Prime rib is one of my favorite meals to have when I go out to eat and I would have to say that this is the best prime rib I have had so far.  It is cooked to perfection and tender enough to be cut with a butter knife.  :)   My only complaint about this place is that it is unbearably hot in there front dinning room and I couldn't wait to leave.  I was in jeans and a short sleeve button up shirt.  I could only imagine how folks in ties and slacks must have felt.  Turn on the AC....</review>

	<review>Their food is good and filling but way too expensive. I can't believe my boyfriend and I made reservations and we still had to wait in their lounge for quite some time. As we seat down, there was a "little steak cart" right behind me. The guy was curving meat behind me and kept on bumping into my chair. I quickly changed seats with my boyfriend. I felt like I was crammed in the back and they set up a two seater a squeeze between two other tables. My advice, only come here for special occasions.</review>

	<review>I have been here at least 10 times within the last year. Every time is super tasty. Every time I come, I get the same thing, English Cut with Mashed Potatoes and Cream Spinach. The piping hot freshly baked whole loaf of bread is fantastic (and I am a huge bread person). I will let the 1,700 something reviews tell you how good this place is, but what I do want to tell you is: 1. Get the ENGLISH CUT medium rare -- meat is absurdly tender and juicy 2. Cream spinach is better than cream corn 3. If you are a small stomached person, here's a TIP: do not be tempted to touch the salad or at most have three bites or else you will not have room for your prime rib. If you are still hungry, they give you a smaller second slice. If you truly are still hungry after that (which is impossible since you may not even finish your first slices), then eat your salad. The salad is very good, too btw. 4. Make reservations because lines are always long. Can be from 1.5 to 2 hours but well worth the wait!</review>

	<review>I can't believe I've never written a review of this place! This is my dad's favorite restaurant of all time..me? not so much. We came here for my BF's company holiday dinner again this year. It seems to be a tradition now. They're pretty bad about seating us, but eh. I didn't like the new jalapeno corn bread thing. My king cut of meat was the first time it was ever close to perfect. Medium-rare, delish! The service was good and bad. Our main server was really nice and funny, but one of the other ones that kept coming (some little asian man) was very very rude and was just plopping things down. The salad was good as usual because I LOVE beats, though it would've been nice if they could've...tossed.. it more. I asked for a fully loaded baked potato and man....was it FULLY LOADED. For dessert the bf and I shared the strawberry shortcake. I didn't care too much for the "cake" part of it as it was too sweet, but the rest was good...you know, the strawberries and cream. HAHA! We also had a bite of someone else's tiramisu, good as usual. I don't come here unless I have to. See you next year HOPR, or maybe for my parents anniversary. Who knows.</review>

	<review>The old, who have not been here in years, will hate this place; the new will think it's so AMAZING; (damn, I hate that word). I am sorry to say it;s not what it used to be; elegant, high end food with quality ingredients and detail in preparation.  Now it has become chain like as a large loud facility so people can yell and celebrate in order to accommodate many and reap in  big bucks.  The meat is now much lower in quality and fatty and the Yorkshire pudding has been relegated to what might be considered as a burnt pancake with the Au-jus, out of a can. After decades, it's no longer a class act but an insult to Haute_cuisine of both today and yesterday. Mi dispiace.</review>

	<review>So close to making it to 4 stars but just missed it --- 3.5 stars. Here's the thing...when expectations are so high...you really expect it to deliver.  My cousin, her husband and two kids were visiting and stayed with my husband and I for a week. During that week, we planned out all the restaurants they wanted to try and which ones we thought they should try. My cousin was told by so many people that when in San Francisco, HOPR is a MUST MUST MUST. One person even told her that it defines San Francisco. Note: HOPR DOES NOT define SF!!! Anyways, we made reservations on open table. Got there 5 mins before our reservation. Waited 10 mins to get seated. A walk in was quoted a 2 hour wait for a table so for all of you out there...make reservations!!! Pluses: -Easy menu-- prime rib or prime rib ;P -Lots of food-- prime rib (you choose a size) + salad + a side (creamed spinach or creamed corn)+ a side of either baked or mashed potato + yorkshire pudding -Not really having to dress up. Jeans and a nice top will do -Laid back atmosphere -Good deal for kid's meal-- same amount of food, just smaller cut of prime rib (although it was close to the city cut) all for $11 Minuses: -Prime Rib--tasted good but I've had equally tasty prime rib elsewhere. Although it was good, it wasn't the best ever. -My cousin said that the cream corn had a weird aftertaste. And my cousin love all things corn. -The wait--if you don't have a reservation -Cramped space. We had a lot of food on a small table and all the tables were really close together. Don't come here if you want to have alone time with your sigfig. Overall, tastes good but I've have equally tasty prime rib elsewhere.</review>

	<review>I had old friends who were stopping in SF on the way back from HI to the East Coast.  They wanted to go to the "best prime rib restaurant" in SF.  According to my friends here in Yelp, the House of Prime Rib was that restaurant.  I hadn't been there for MANY years.  We got there ahead of our friends and were treated to exceptional warmth by a server in the lounge and by an elderly gentleman, who may have been an owner.   When our friends arrived, we were seated promptly.  We had reservations.  The waiter was a young guy with a shaved head whose main job may have been as a "server" at the local Sizzler.  I had brought a '95 Groth Cabernet, that I had been saving for such an occasion.  The oaf started to bring the cork up, then went 90degrees and broke the cork.  He then said: "I'm gonna have to push it in."  I said: "no you aren't." and grabbed the bottle and corkscrew from him and extracted the cork.  The H of PR features a demonstration salad.  Said OAF was shaking some spice mixture on top of this salad and was just about to scrape a layer of said spice off when the elderly gentleman came to the rescue.  He made the oaf get us a new salad.  The prime rib was acceptable, not special, but our experience was dreadful.</review>

	<review>I love this place! Went here a couple nights ago to celebrate the occasion. The atmosphere is nice, but a little loud. The place was extremely busy saturday night, but that is to be expected. Here are some pointers... 1. There is a lot of food and you get seconds! So if you are not a big salad fan or want to skip the salad to eat more meat, go for the a la cart. You get everything in the dinner except the salad and you save $7. 2. My wife got the salad and I went a la cart and the salad she got was big enough for the both of us. That is another thing to think about, sharing the salad. The salad is DELICIOUS though, don't get me wrong. 3. The city cut does not give you seconds, but everything else does. My recommendation is the house of prime rib cut. YUM. 4. Cream spinach is better than the cream corn. If you want AMAZING cream corn, do yourself a favor and fly yourself to Austin, TX and go to Rudy's Country BBQ. Amazing brisket and amazing cream corn (shout out to TEXAS!) 5. The mash potatoes aren't anything amazing. Not bad though, but I think next time I will go with the baked potato. The potato is LOADED with butter, sour cream, and bacon bits. It will give you a heart attach, but a smile on your face. 6. Yorkshire pudding is AWESOME. IT is like a flat piece of bread, but some creamy goodness in it. Can't explain it, but delicious! 7. GET RESERVATIONS. They run out FAST. I would suggest at LEAST two weeks in advance for the weekend, probably even before that to be safe. Trust me on this. Do yourself a favor and if you are in San Francisco, go and eat at House of Prime Rib!</review>

	<review>meh, way overrated and the furthest from classy. As warned, we waited for a half hour past our reservation to be seated. It was so loud that we had to yell during dinner to hear each other. They must advertise in all the tourist magazines because it was full of people in tee shirts speaking foreign languages. This place reminds me of a chain steak house like Houstons with no style whatsoever and the primary goal of packing in as many people and shoving as much prime rib as possible down their throats. Overall bad dining experience with pretty good food. I will stick to Harris' next time for a relaxing and enjoyable dining experience that includes cow.</review>

	<review>Somewhat disappointed based on the hyped up reviews. I am opting fo 3 stars because we got ours to-go and maybe eating in would do a world of difference (especially to get that 2nd free slice!). Although I am not even sure there will be a second trip... First off, Im from out of town and I am in hospital and my mom is with me, we come to s.f. often and had heard about this from a worker a couple years ago and have been wanting to try it out. My mom and aunt walked to HOPR on friday night, I already knew they probably would have to wait since friday and no reservations... well they walked in and the hostess said 5th on list. I guess they went to the bar and had 2 margaritas and then I think hour or hour and half later when to check again and they were still 5th since obviously reservations need to be sat first, but only then did they find that out from the hostess... so they left, the hostess said they do to go orders though. So sunday rolls around and we decide to do the to-go order option because we really wanted to try it (and hostess said minimum of 2 week reservation needed). You can NOT call in, you must go in and order then wait (why?). Anyways 3 of us tried the english cut due people saying its normally more tender, we had the boy try the House cut (approximately 11 oz... umm 6 oz must be the bone in). The prime rib was definately tasty, especially with the au jous, and we did notice the english was more tender than the big house cut. They didnt ask us on the sides though just gave us all the creamed spinach, salad, and yorkshire pudding. I know my mom specified one to have mashed potatoes instead of baked, the gravy with the mashed sucked to me as well as the potatoes. The bakers on the other hand were good especially soaked with au jous. Their au jous is pretty good, but not the best I've had. I would have rather had creamed corn though instead of spinach. My BIGGEST complaint though is the price for the sizes is RIDICULOUS! My aunt asked I guess the "city cut" is around 7 oz (~$35), "house cut and english (i guess)" around 11 oz (~$37) [also liked how the menu doesnt list sizes just the "type" fyi a "small" portion is different to everyone] but like i said, most of it was a huge bone! I am hoping it is because we got everything to-go but I know that if I went in I could eat that first helping of prime rib EASY as well as the second, dont know where people are getting the huge portions from (Im from Nevada, and we like steaks... if those portions are huge to bay areaians what do you eat?! haha).  Fyi: they also do not do kid orders to-go either (~$11). and make sure to get spicy horseradish b/c the mild tastes disgusting.... there isnt an ounce of spice. I want to try eating in, hoping that is a different experience I just dont know if I can force myself to spend so much money again for such small cuts of prime rib and craptacular sides... Plusses: salad dressing was very delicious, and gave us two whole bottles! managed to include everything we needed for to-go order (au jous, butter, sour cream, utensils etc) tasty prime rib when soaked in au jous Cons: creamed spinach gross, never offered for creamed corn yorkshire pudding and a roll of sour dough bread? too much bread stuff crap load of beets on the salad mashed potatoes &amp; gravy tasted like cheap flour gravy at reno buffets PRICE for PORTIONS no kids orders to-go (what if you have kids?) no call in take out orders you must go inside and order then wait</review>

	<review>Don't expect to be able to finish your food. The portions are enormous. If I ever come back, I would definitely get the City Cut. All the other cuts are the exact same meat prepared in the same way with the exact same seasoning, but just larger and more expensive. This should really be 3.5 stars - the place was nice and the service was phenomenal. The food was pretty good, though I'm not much of a prime rib fan in the first place, so I'm giving a 3 since I've definitely enjoyed myself more at other steak houses.</review>

	<review>Even though the House of Prime Rib offers a classic interior, it does feel like a touristy trap.  Kinda like an American upscale version of Benihana. They cut your slice of meat right at the table.  It's kinda neat actually.  The prime rib is good but it's nothing to boast about.  Prime rib isn't the most flavorful of cuts.  If you like it tender and moist, I guess it will satisfy.  But c'mon where's the flavor?  At least they had horseradish cream to spice things up. We all had salads and of course the yorkshire pudding as well as the cream spinach.  The salad isn't that good.  The sides are good but man are they filling!  If the prime rib won't fill you up, these will certainly do the "trick". You do get an additional slice if the one prior doesn't fill you up.  This slice is however rather stingy. ____ I'd rather go to a trendy restaurant with frou frou foam.</review>

	<review>If I'm craving quality prime rib, then HPR is where I'd go. I opted for the King Henry VIII cut - why not, right?! It was absolutely delicious - super juicy! The overall dining experience is fun, service is great and very friendly, and their prices are pretty reasonable. If you love prime rib, are looking for a unique dining experience, and appreciate good food, then definitely check out House of Prime Rib - you won't be disappointed.  The reason I'm not salivating as I write this review is that I'm not a the biggest prime rib fan so there are other steakhouses in the city that are higher up on my list.</review>

	<review>My fiance and I went here last night for dinner to celebrate our engagement. I was reminded how much we love this place. It truly is a San Francisco landmark and every San Franciscan has to go here at least once. I love the entire ambiance of it, each room is exquisite in design. Their food is more than excellent, you will leave fully stuffed. I enjoy everything from beginning to end. Their salad with the house dressing is hella good and they give you a huge helping of it. I love how the waiter makes a whole show about it, the way they twirl the serving dish, I just think its so cool. The creamed spinach just melts in your mouth good and the yorkshire pudding is to die for. But the meat, oh the meat. Its so succulent, flavorful and juicy and cooked to perfection. I tend to order the city cut which is approximately 7-8 oz and its perfect for me. My fiance ordered the huge King Henry VIII cut. Trust me you will leave satisfied. Besides the food, I have to compliment the staff. They are more than accommodating and considerate and always pleasant. We loved our waiter last night, Manolo. He was the best. He took care of us really well and made our celebration that much more perfect. You cannot get any better than this place.</review>

	<review>One of my favorite restaurants in the bay area!  Their prime rib is close to the best I've had and the price is very reasonable.  House of Prime Rib is always crowded but they're pretty good about reservations.  They also serve you seconds or thirds to guarantee that you leave full.  I can't eat as much as I used to so even their regular servings are more than adequate.  The other reason I like coming here is for their salad.  I don't know what they put in their secret dressing but I love it!</review>

	<review>This is place is too good to be true. It is too popular though, so even if you have reservations, you might still have a 30 minute wait.   The place is pretty cramped, but what do you expect?   Bread...the free bread.   Served warm!  =) It was good, but not like the best bread ever. LOL. Prime rib = best I have ever tasted.  I had the English cut because I like my meat thinly sliced.  I had it made medium well and it was perfect.  Still juicy, and so  yummy.  I had it with a side of the cream spinach which was ok, but I prefer the creamed corn.  My boyfriend got the creamed corn and I was totally picking at his. Yorkshire pudding = yummy!  So good I wanted some more.  Baked potato tasted like any I've tasted.   For dessert we had the English Trifle and the Bread Pudding.  Both pretty good, but not so good I would rave about it.   5 stars for the good service, quick service, and the good prime rib..because thats pretty much what we came there for. Price is not bad for the amount of food either.  YUM!</review>

	<review>They do a few things, and they do them well. The meat and the potatoes are great. I don't like the creamed spinach (bacon, gross!) and am not crazy about the creamed corn (meh). Spinning salad is great. Love the selection of horseradish. The Yorkshire Pudding is great. Cornbread is good too. I don't like the loaf of bread but only because I don't like Sourdough (yes, I am a San Franciscan, and I'm aware that it's wrong, but so be it). One thing to be aware of is the amount of salt in the food. It is not overly salted, but because of the salt in everything (meat, salad, mashed potatoes), it can catch up to you. Valet parking is great. They only lose one star because of their own popularity; I can't think of a time I've gone and actually been seated at the time of my reservation. On a good day it's only 15 minutes past reservation time. Last night was crowded; it was 30 minutes. I assume it's because they are very busy these days. Almost forgot to mention they are generous with dog bones! I usually give them a rinse to clean away some of the salt and any other food on them and take them away as soon as the dogs strip all the meat off the bones.</review>

	<review>This place pretty much has just Prime Rib on the menu, 3 different cuts &amp; is done well. Nothing wrong with that. They do offer a fish special as well, but if your coming here for the namesake, then don't be steered off course. There is no apps, but non needed considering the all the food you get prior the the slab of meat piled onto your plate. Sourdough bread, cornbread, cream of corn or spinach, baked or mashed potatoes. I'd recc getting the the 2 larger cuts only because you can get seconds. That is if you have room. This place is an institution and has been around since something like 1948? Kudos for keeping this place looking incredibly clean &amp; well maintained. Service was good &amp; personable. I'll def be back!</review>

The concept is simple, choose your cut, choose baked or mashed, choose spinach or corn, then sit back, unhinge your jaw, and let the gluttony begin. First, they drop a round of piping hot sourdough on your table.  Caution: muster your self-restraint, it's delicious but if you eat it all, you may explode before the end of the evening.  Then out comes the salad which is tossed with a signature dressing full of secret ingredients (one of which is obviously crack).  Finally, the chef shows up at your table with a cart of meat, potatoes and sides.  As if your table isn't already piled high enough with calories and deliciousness, your waiter returns and plunks a piece of yorkshire pudding on your plate.  Amazing.  Two hours later, you unbutton the top button on your pants and wander out onto Van Ness in a protein haze. I recommend going early, especially on a weekend.  Their first reservation is at 4:30, which is a great choice because it's not crowded, there's no wait and you have the rest of the evening to recover.</review>

	<review>HOPR, is a place that everyone talks about. Is it worth they hype? I believe so. I love prime rib, and it's definitely worth the visit. I recommend making reservations. A friend and I decided to go on a Sunday, during labor day weekend. I had called on the Saturday, and the only reservation they had left was for 10 pm. Well, we were leaving the next morning. So 10 pm, it was. We arrived a little early, and still had to wait another 10 minutes. The place was packed. There were people showing up, and unfortunately being turned away. Luckily, we were seated in a booth in the corner. It was nice, to people watch. There were a bunch of tables scattered around, which would make it a bit awkward to be sitting in. But, luckily we got a great seat. Our server was very straight forward and nice. We were his last table, so I bet he was happy that the night was almost over. He was still attentive. There is pretty much only prime rib on the menu. Hence the name. There was one fish option that I saw. Anyway, they bring you the most delicious side of sour dough bread. You know you shouldn't fill up on bread, but the gluttonous being that I am, couldn't help but nibble on the warm crusty sour dough. I decided to get the second prime rib cut. The HOPR cut, which was a lot for a lady, but of course I had made the decision to savor every bite. Since we were able to choose all of the sides. We both got the creamed spinach, the yorkshire pudding, mashed potatoes and the salad. Yeah, I know what you're thinking, that's a lot of food. Well, the sides are just that sides. Something to nibble on, while taking breaks from the hefty portion of meat. The prime rib, was delicious. Tender, and medium rare just the way I like it. The fat on it wasn't too obnoxious. Just right. The sides, I could probably care less for. I would definitely recommend HOPR, if you feel like treating yourself to a nice piece of succulent juicy prime rib. It would definitely be a place for a romantic date, a place to take your mom on her birthday. Any occasion really. It still has it's old school charm. Great service. We spent $50 each including tip. As for dessert, we passed. I'd be passed out on my plate. Make reservations, and make sure you're hungry!</review>

	<review>Oh my, I had forgotten what a good steak is supposed to taste like.   I have been disappointed with so many other steaks.  Thank you House of Prime Rib for restoring my faith in the goodness that is the simplicity of a well prepped, aged cut. And your Yorkshire pudding.  I love it almost as much as I love your steak. There's two little things that keep this from a 5 star review though: 1) Service, though usually excellent, wasn't quite up to par on a busy night.  There should be no reason why a salad is brought to a table in front of 7 hungry people and then not served for 10 minutes. 2) Ladies, beware of the english cut if you are eating with boys.  The english cut is a thin cut.  Since you are a lady, they will serve you first (to be expected), on a hot plate (also to be expected).  However, you may find that your steak gets cooked on your hot plate whilst the boys at your table get served.  Just something to think about. Other than those two little things, I have nothing but fond memories of the House of Prime Rib.  Food is excellent, the wait staff is nice, the prices are good, they'll give you extra meat if you find that you are still hungry after your massive meal, and I always have a good time.</review>

	<review>Prime rib = good. Salad = overrated. Sides = good. Service = Great. Prices = expensive. I'm not sure I could come back here...as it's expensive, and I'm not a huge fan of prime rib.  I went because my out-of-state friends wanted to go.   Priceless moment = skanky women with too much makeup, too many accessories and too much  skin showing... yeah, they looked like barely legal escort/call girls.  lol</review>

	<review>My BF took me here last month for our "monthly" anniversary. He had made reservations for us at 8pm but we were late about 10 minutes trying to get parking, so unfortunately we lost our table and had to wait another half hour :( When our names were finally called, we were led to the room in the back where there was a large party who was just seated a little while before we were, judging on their salad course. I'm all for celebrating with a large group of friends, but when you're trying to have a nice romantic dinner with your boyfriend, it just sucks having to yell across the table to have a conversation cuz it's so loud in the room. Our server was a sweet lady, it was just a tad difficult to decipher what she was saying from time to time. So about the food, what can I say? The salad was good, but not as phenomonal as most reiewers made it out to be. The sides were all just, sides... Average at best. But the prime rib was indeed, delicious... I asked for mine medium rare, and it cut like buttah. Mmm! If you're a carnivore like me, definitely try to make a visit out here for the prime rib!</review>

	<review>Smashingly good prime rib. Lonnie A. and Lael A. had taken me out here once before and the service was impeccable. Our waiter was prompt and courteous and the food was top notch. Despite our rezzy the place was so packed we ended up waiting about 10-15 minutes before being seated. Our waiter felt so bad for us he comped us a bottle of red wine. Winner.  Talk about sweetenin up the deal. Needless to say we left  with stomachs full, slightly tipsy and onward to the bars to finish off the night. That was a good 5 years ago. My most recent visit to The House was even better. We ended up grabbing a drink in the bar as our table was being set and chatted it up with the bartender for a bit. We were eventually seated and our server quickly came by to introduce himself and take our order. My chick got the city cut while i settled on the house cut. Before the meat even hit the table we were already stuffed off the hot sour dough bread and huge salad. Luckily I've been trained to to finish whatever food is put before me (thanks, Mom) and i managed to fit my juicy meat, baked potato, creamed spinach, Yorkshire pudding and a bit of my dates food all into one stomach. I haven't eaten since. It's so damn good. That eggy Yorkshire pudding is great - i could eat it for breakfast, lunch, merienda, dinner and as a midnight snack. Don't test me either. At the end of it all, my date and i had both deftly managed to loosen up our belts to accommodate our bulging bellies. i think what makes this place that much better is the staff - the hostess, server, bar tender and manager ALL treated us as if we were the most important people in the room. I love it. Whether in shorts and a tee or decked out in a three piece suit, these guys always seem to come correct, and its that right there that i respect most about this restaurant. Get some.</review>

	<review>"House of Prime Rib'' is a great restaurant for prime rib lover's.  They have great cuts of prime rib and the sides are tasty too.  Make sure to get the creamed spinach because it's extremely delicious.  It is a little on the pricey side, but well worth it.  If you order the large cut of prime rib and finish it, you get a second slice for free.  The only bad thing about HoPR is that the parking is not so great. So, for those with cars, make sure and give your self some time to park!   and...HoPR has a really great bar as well!</review>

	<review>I had heard so much positive feedback about this place, now i must confess I'm not a big meat eater, but as I had the chance to attend with some friends I decided to go along and see what all the fuss is about. We made our reservation for a table of 7 for 8pm, got there at 755 and were asked to wait in the lounge area and they would come and get us, this seemed fine, we sat by the lovely fireplace and ordered some drinks, whilst we were waiting for our drinks we were given some little glasses of nuts, which I must say were very very yummy :) By the time we were finally seated it was past 830, now i cant remember so this bit maybe wrong, but i think we didn't actually get our drinks until we were sat at the table. We ordered our food, i went for the smallest/cheapest option (sorry cant remember which cut that was). We were served some very nice warm bread and butter, although i only had a small piece as i didn't want to 'ruin my main course'. We were then served the salad, the disappointing part being the waiter perfomed the salad toss behind me and we were all busy chatting so missed it :( however i did get to watch the table next to us get their salad and it was impressive. In our group i was one of two women, so we got served our food first, not sure if the chef was exceptionally slow that night, but by the time he had served everyone and I started to eat mine was on the lukewarm side. I ordered mashed potato and creamed corn, and also had the yorkshire pudding, the yorkshire pudding was very good (and this is coming from a Brit!), the creamed corn and mashed potato were very very salty, so much that i had to leave them and only ate the meat and yorkshire pudding. Everyone else really enjoyed their meal and most of our party said they would go back again (my husband has been numerous times now) So I'm giving them 3 stars, i knocked one off for the wait for our table when we had a reservation and another one for the saltiness of the food, i would have given them 3.5 if I was able, but they don't deserve a 4, so i had to give them 3.</review>

	<review>When did they stop bringing the cart over to your table and carving the hunky slab of beeeef right in front of you?!   When did they start putting so much dressing on the salad that it's a pool of pink with crunchy bits you'd like to wipe off first?   When did the Yorkshire Pudding become as flat as a pancake? When did the watresses stop being around long enough to stand still for ONE freaking MINUTE and make contact?   The orders are all so very simple so how about a smile that doesn't remind me of table turnover dreams at Dennys.  I've been very happy here before, the prime rib is still the greatest, but it was a much more sucky experience last time.  Sliding downhill, hope they put on the brakes.  Someone.  Please.   A steakhouse or any horseradish should be HOT, not freaking creamy - that is plain wrong!  Just decided to drop another star for the horseradish like mayo.  Damn.</review>

	<review>I tried to order the fish, but everyone talked me into the prime rib.  The dinner was incredible from start to finish. Dinner starts with sourdough bread and butter plus a side of corn bread, followed by a salad tossed at your table.  You get to choose between mash and baked potatoe, then cream corn or cream spinach.  The Prime Rib is rolled over in cart.  Your prime rib is cut at your table.  It is absolutely delicious.  I wish that I had room for dessert, there were so many good choices.</review>

	<review>I was so excited to go to this place.  Its been talked about forever.  I crave a nice steak every now and then, with a baked potato, side salad and a glass of red vino.  It seemed like a fun spot to be honest.  Good service, nice crowd, but. . .but!!!!!!  I will always remember this moment and I don't think I can ever forget it.  I hate to say this, but my friend and I started with the side salad.  Tossed in front of us and served.  Yum Yum, munching, munching, then my friend instantly pauses.  He puts his finger into his mouth and pulls out a piece of glass.  My jaw drops and we immediately call the waiter over.  We received a lot of apologies, even from the manager, but this is all they did.  They compensated us only a bottle of wine, which was about $35.00.  Um, hello . .. . a piece of glass dude.  What if he bit into it?  What if he choked on it.  Think mouthful of blood, ER visit, scaring your customers, etc, etc, etc. . . .They should of comped the whole dinner.  Its been a while now, but I won't ever return there.  I loved the quality of the steak, but still, every time I think of this place, I think of glass in the mouth.   Think I'll stick with Tommy's Joint up the street instead.  Thanks!</review>

	<review>This is a SF institution my friends, and all you fools out there trying to punk HOPR can eat crow.  It does one thing and it does it well...order something other than the PR,which is what people who gave less than 3 stars likely did.  Clearly you had no idea what you were doing, and I bet on your way over from the East Bay or Marin that evening, you either had no money or Fast Track to pay the toll.  You can't take a square peg and put into a round hole, so order the Pasta or Salmon at your own risk...</review>

	<review>40 minute wait with a reservation. I kept asking myself "Why would anyone visit the House of Prime Rib"? Simple: An out of town guest craving lots of meat! The problem is that the "meat" was served cold, the food was overpriced and unfortunately, the overall experience was not something I would rate 4 stars. Why so many 4 star ratings? At best, this reminded me of bad cafeteria food. Nothing about this place was ok.</review>

	<review>HOPR is a prime example (pun intended) of the value of specialization.  Their modus operandi has to be "do only one thing, but do it unbelievably, ridiculously well."  HOPR has prime rib down to a science, and I can't think of a time I've had a better cut.  Not only does this specialization allow for tried and true recipes that have been perfected over the years, but it also allows for incredible economies of scale.  HOPR keeps input costs low and passes the savings on to their customers.  Cuts range from $33 to $38, a great deal for what turns out to be unlimited prime rib and sides. And now on to the ambiance, which has a very classic feel.  HOPR is a San Francisco institution, and they never have a vacant table.  Hence, be prepared to wait to be seated (even with a reservation), but good things (very, very good things) come to those who wait. One bone to pick however:  The wine list is too small.  For a prime rib place of this caliber, I'd expect a better selection.</review>

My husband and I split the smallest meal they offer and we both needed to be rolled out of there in wheel barrels. OMG it was good.

	<review>You know what you're getting when you come here.  Prime Rib!  It's been a couple of years since I've ate here and as I'm sure you all know, it never changes.  The quality and the food stays the same.  We came here to celebrate NYE last night, getting a 10:30pm seating.  We were the first to arrive and the gf ordered a lemon drop.  The drink was a good deal because they gave you a shaker for the vodka which basically meant you can get seconds. We were seated at a table that had an annoying plant poking us so we requested to change tables and they were very happy to accommodate our needs.  We all ordered our food and it was very good.  We got the usual sides, the yorkshire pudding, and the corn bread.   When it came time to countdown, they turned on the TV which was right above our table and they gave us hats and whistles (they aren't whistles but something else) and complimentary champagne to toast.   Service was great, we all had a great time.  And the best thing about this is the price for dinner is the same as it usually is, no NYE adjustment and valet parking at $8 was worth it since it's hard to find parking on the street on NYE.</review>

	<review>MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN THE WHOLE ENTIRE WORLD!!!! First of all, you HAVE to get the King Henry Cut or else it's just not as good. My sister learned the hard way. She finished the King Henry Cut when she was 11 years old...( don't ask me how she did it...I still don't know) and there was still a lot of meat on the bone but they took it away and gave her a small, thin slice afterwards (Yes, they give you a complimentary slice if you finish your plate!) The thin slice just wasn't the same as a 1+ inch thick piece of meat. I would recommend just taking the bone home and eat it the next day rather than getting the extra piece! Seriously though, get the biggest cut because it's only like a couple dollars more and it's so much more worth it. Leftovers the next day are just as good =) They first come out with fresh, warm bread (Don't eat too much or else you won't have room for the actual entree!) Then comes the salad where they prepare in front of you. It is seriously amazing...best salad I've ever had. The dressing is soooo good. They are very generous with it (I love my salads drenched in dressing haha) so definitely let them know if you aren't a fan of too much dressing. Your entree also comes with either Baked or Mashed potatoes ( I definitely recommend the Baked unless you don't like sour cream), Creamed spinach or creamed corn ( I recommend the spinach), Yorkshire pudding, and fresh cornbread. AMAZING deal for the price you pay. I've been here almost 10 times and the service and food have been great every single time (except once when I ordered medium, and it was more like well-done). That's why I recommend asking for your meat cooked rarer than you usually like it... for example, I always get medium rare because I like it medium. For some reason, it's always been like that for me. I don't know about anyone else? EVERYONE NEEDS TO COME HERE AT LEAST ONCE TO TRY IT! I KNOW I'VE SAID AMAZING 100 TIMES IN THE REVIEW BUT IT REALLY IS AMAZING. TIP: Don't come here if you don't like meat!</review>

	<review>What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said? House of Prime Rib (or as we like to say, HOPR) is a true SF staple. The menu is simple, but that's a good thing. For the most part, you'll be deciding between the HOPR cut (thicker cut) or the English cut (thinner cut). I've had both, and both are delicious; it all depends on your preference. Along with your generous portion of prime rib, you'll get a salad (prepared at your table), your choice of mashed or baked potato, your choice of creamed spinach or creamed corn, and yorkshire pudding (a really light, airy piece of bread). They provide you with 3 different levels of horseradish: mild, medium, or hot. I prefer the hot, but just keep in mind that a little goes a LONG way. Once you finish your prime rib, if you're still hungry, they'll offer you a slightly smaller piece free of charge. This place is truly awesome. The food and service are both great. I'll be coming back as often as I can!</review>

	<review>This place is bad ass. It's been several years since I've been there but I am going back shortly for my b-day. Extremely looking forward to it. As its name implies what they do &amp; do really well is Prime Rib. I have vivid memories of my medium rare cut melting in my mouth. I'm salivating just thinking about it. Juicy &amp; cooked to perfection I couldn't have asked for a better cut of meat. I seem to remember there being side dishes but my memory fails me. All I can think about is how good the prime rib is. I mean how much better can it get? But wait it does. They wheel the damn meat right to your table so you can see / pick what you're getting right from the source. These people don't mess around. Its a busy, bustling place so make reservations. Show up a little early and enjoy some tasty beverages in their old school cocktail bar. Cheers!</review>

	<review>I can't believe that I have not written a review on this place yet. I come here pretty often. If you want a big meaty dinner, this is the place to go. It has an old-time fancy feel and a easy to navigate menu. Great place for a date !  The salad is different, but it's neat that they make it at the table. The bread Pudding stuff that they serve leaves much to be desired but the veggies and the meat are amazing and every time I have eaten here I left satisfied. I would recommend getting reservations as they always seem busy.</review>

	<review>Ok, so don't get me wrong - HOPR has still got some delicious prime rib and all, but they're starting to skimp: - What?  No more halfsies on the creamed corn and spinach? - What?  If I order seconds and can't finish, I can't take my leftovers home? - What?  You no longer offer complimentary group photos? Despite these disappointing discoveries, HOPR remains an SF staple and continues to serve top notch food, including their signature salad, which marks the only beet dish I've ever eaten and actually enjoyed to date.</review>

	<review>House of Prime Rib has been a favorite of mine for years. This very popular San Francisco fixture has always had great food, table service, and ambiance. My only peeve is how particularly picky they are in seating parties that are not all present at time of reservation. If you are interested in a nice, romantic or just intimate dinner go here. You will not be disappointed. The price tag is a bit on the steep side but you get quite a bit for the buck ($35 - $40 per person). All prime rib dinners come wiith sourdough bread &amp; butter, salad, fresh cream spinach or cream corn, mashed potatoes or baked potato, Yorkshire pudding, and ofcourse prime rib. Definitely a good place to go for those special occasions. On the way out make sure to grab some of their after-dinner chocolate peppermints... delicious! P.S. For all you carnivores out there... a small seconds is available if you finish your initial serving of prime rib. Just let your waiter/waitress know.</review>

	<review>Don't expect to be seated even when you have a reservation. The staff will lie to you that you will be seated "in just a few minutes". After almost 2 hours of waiting, they''ll blame you for not being seated by claiming that you didn't understand their directions or that you were late (which you weren't). Take your money to a place that values YOU and treats you with respect. On an earlier visit, I found a staple in my food (it was stuck in my gums)Their reaction? To offer a free dessert. NO thank you.</review>

	<review>Okay, so last night I took a lady friend here for her Brithday as she's never been here and although she LOVES Prime rib, she hardly eats beef.  So She was really excited to go here.  It was a last minute idea, so I could only get a 9:30 reservation.  They said I could come early and check in and they'll give me priority seating to try &amp; get me earlier.  We checked in at 8:30 and it was packed.  We managed to find to seats at the bar to wait so we indulged in their popular Lemon Drops and Cosmos.  Bartender was a great drink craftsmen and a warm presence.  We were finally seated with a half hour and were taken care of by our server, Jonathan.  We were given good suggestions on some Pinot Noir, and he was pretty standard as far as service.   I took a star from the review for a couple reasons.... 1. I  ordered the King Henry VIII Cut....and it was NOT 1" thick...I KNOW....I've been here enough!  But I NEVER send food back (you know why).   My cut was about the same size as my lady friend's HOPR Cut....It came out Medium Rare as expected, but this time around it kinda lacked it's signature flavor.  If I knew it would have come out like this, I would have taken my friend to Black Angus fro Christ's sake.  I also didn't like Jonathan's approach to how I wanted my horseradish...I asked him "how hot is the very hot horse radish?" and he sort of sighed and said in a brush-me-off kind of tone "Tell you what, I'll give you the very hot and i'll bering you a scoop of mayo and you can make it as hot as you want it"  I let that one go... Then, he saw how quickly i finished my prime rib, and for the first time I was NOT asked if I would like a second slice as I am entitled to for ordering the King Henry VIII cut.  I actually had to ask HIM for one!  In this setting, it kind of sounds cheap of me to ask, right people!?  So he said "sure I'll get it for you....Now for part 2.... 2.  THEY MICROWAVED MY PRIME RIB!!!!!  That second slice was grainy, flavorless, and the whole plate was hot.!!!! You KNOW that means it was microwaved!!! Why!??? Microwaving a slice of $20 prime rib is one thing, but $40 prime rib?  NO NO!!!!!  You screwed up BIG time, man!   Through all this, I maintained composure because this evening was not about me, it was about my lady friend, and she enjoyed her Prime Rib.  I made NO gesture of disappointment, so that the evening would not be ruined.  MY bill of a King Henry VIII Cut, HOPR Cut, and a bottle of Wild Horse Pinot Noir came out to $133.  Reasonable, for a place that is known for giving good service and a cozy, clean setting.  I didn't feel I even got my money's worth.   In conclusion, Jonathan was the difference maker in my experience here.  I've been here quite a few times and have never left this place feeling like I did.  Maybe he thought I was a cheap tipper (even though I tipped him $30...and I usually tip a higher percentage).  He could have done TWO things to make this trip worthwhile.... 1. ASK ME if I want that second piece, you're the first to not have asked me....and 2. INFORM me that you would have to microwave that second slice of prime rib to make it medium rare...I would have just told you to give it to me as it was!!!!!!   You know what... writing this review made me cough up another star.   I do plan on coming back here, as the other dozens of times in the past I've had a great experience here. Just remember to make sure that if you get a second slice that they do NOT microwave it.</review>

	<review>Vastly overrated, considering all the high ratings from fellow yelpers. Being a native San Franciscan, I have walked or driven by many times, but never ate here until last evening.  My neighbors invited me to dinner, so it would be rude to say no. The service rates five stars, but the food is incredibly bad, unless you have low standards.  I cannot deny the old school ambiance of this place, but the food defines the rating for me. First, we come in and the hostess steers us toward the bar.  After a short wait, we are seated in an old fashioned booth. The waiter politely takes our order.  We are first served dried up french bread, followed by a mediocre salad saturated by salad dressing.  I am served a rare cut of prime rib with generous marbling of fat.  I would say that at least 20% of my prime rib was fat.  For USDA prime, the meat was incredibly chewy and tough.   I regularly cook better prime rib than this place.  Since the menu choices are limited, we automatically get creamed spinach, a potato dish, burned corn bread, and Yorkshire pudding, which were all below average. For a restaurant that prides itself on prime rib and only serves prime rib, the main dish was rather disappointing.  I much prefer the other steak houses.</review>

	<review>I hope this place never changes, as it is our old standby when we are in the mood for prime rib.  Everything, from the silly spinning salad that got me to actually like beets and crave celery salt in salad, to the desserts I'd normally never eat (like a trifle)--I love the whole package and the prime rib is always perfect.  I saw the comment that said "asian parents will love this place" and laughed--so true!  I had my wedding rehearsal dinner here nearly a decade ago and both sets of parents still talk about that meal.  I wish there were more of these in the bay area.  Oh, we've also taken a toddler there and had a great time.</review>

	<review>This place really is a San Francisco landmark, because my party still had to wait a good 20 minutes despite having a reservation for 10pm.  10pm!  Ridiculous.  (yes, I still eat late.) But after we were seated, the food ordering went by quickly and we were left to chill with the really hard sourdough bread (we're talking teeth shattering here).  The salad spinning presentation was pretty cool, and the beets in the salad were good. When the sides and ribs came out, I was actually disappointed in the serving portion of the smaller cuts--Yelp led me to believe that an English cut would be enough to fill me up, while a King Henry would be something like impossible to finish.  This was not the case, as the male contingent of the group pretty much inhaled the bone-in King Henry and asked for the complimentary slice.  The flavor of the prime rib with the extra jus and choices of horseradish was really good, and left me wanting more. The sides were hearty enough to fill me up, but of course I would have preferred more meat.  Oh well.  Service was still pretty great, and the atmosphere has a very 'dining club' feel--it was an evening of great food to bolster against a chilly night.</review>

	<review>The Stepford House of Prime Rib ? It's funny, I meant to go to Harris' and accidentally ended up here, oh well. Can I tell their story without telling my own ? Anymore I just feel jaded, have I dined out so much in my life that there is nothing new under the sun ? This is like the Disneyland of Steak Houses, the staff is cheerful, and chipper, and everyone smiles, and says "hi" all . . . the . . . time. It's like the employees have been beaten with the customer service whip, and frankly, it made me a little nervous. Could I go to the bathroom without being greeted 17 times on the way ? I dunno, what's the flip side, do I like haughty waiters who look down on me with disdain, and treat me like crap ? I can answer that, I do not. Is the word, forced ? Forced geniality, yes, I think that's it. Now in fairness it also could've been the clientele, I saw some very poor fashion, and I'm not even talking East Bay tacky, I'm talking middle America bad fashion, AND one table over from where we sat a guy was wearing flip flops. Really ? Was he on his way to the beach and then for some reason took a wrong turn and ended up at the H.O.P.R. ? The server was nice, rushed, but a nice guy, I guess I can't say it was a bad experience but I wouldn't go back, ever. I think it's one of those places that caters to tourists, a place where if the in-laws are in town and they are from say Des Moines and want to hit a "classy" place while they're in "Frisco," yeah, like that. For me, I blame myself, I should've gone to the Brazenhead, I know better, sigh.</review>

	<review>Tasty prime rib, lean and it comes with a lot of sides you can take home for breakfast!!! I love the salad and service with a smile.... If you want a second serving, you have to finish your first but the 2nd is very tiny if you have the appetite for it.... sides come in a wide variety of items and also ask for the fried egg bread.....</review>

	<review>My bf and I were visiting the bay area, and he really wanted to eat here after seeing it featured on "No Reservations." I must say that the service was excellent. We made reservations for a party of 4 at 7 pm, and while we were on time, the other 2 in our party were late (by about 15 min). I was a little worried, but the host did not get on our case much less mention a word. I loved our waiter. He was very welcoming, friendly, and he made us laugh throughout the night. I ordered the House of Prime Rib Cut. Dinners come with salad, mashed potatoes (or baked potato), Yorkshire pudding, and creamed spinach. The salad was the first food to arrive. The dining experience was very interactive--the waiter mixes all the components of the salad in front of you, including the dressing, which I actually wish he hadn't. I always like to have my dressing on the side because I don't like a whole lot in my salads... well this one had wayy too much. It was a huge portion, so it was too bad it was overdone like that. Then the rest of the sides arrive. The mashed potatoes were decent, but they were kinda cafeteria-esque. Creamed spinach good as well, but nothing special. The Yorkshire pudding I had never had before, but I liked it because it tasted like a popover, which I haven't had in years! When the meat is brought out, your slice is cut in front of you. My House of Prime Rib Cut was definitely huge! It was tender, cooked the right amount, and was very juicy, but I don't know, it really could've used more flavor, maybe even a simple thing as more salt. Anyway, after you finish your prime rib, they offer you an extra slice of meat (I think it was 2 oz?) on the house. I went for it! Man was I stuffed at the end of that meal... I could barely walk. Anyway, in the end, although the service was great, I thought the food was just fairly good, not outstanding, and I was expecting more for how much it cost. (It came out to $97 for 2 people, including tax and tip).</review>

	<review>If you're not a big meat eater, don't come here (should have been pretty obvious to me, but I was willing to give it a try for my boyfriend). So, needless to say, I'm not a big meat eat eater and did NOT enjoy this at all. First off, the ambiance and atmosphere is weeeriiddd (am I the only one who thinks so?) it's like "old world" with tacky dark woods. The service was very nice, but as for the food ICK, not my cup of tea! The salad was like something you would get on an airplane, and everything was just too much! ew and I don't like how they carve the meat in front of you, can't you just do that in the backkkk!?</review>

	<review>My feelings on House of Prime Rib are a classic case of "it's not you, it's me". I started drooling when I saw the name of this place. Sirloin, NY Strip, steak tips, brisket, filet mignon, picanha -- I love it all. House of Prime Rib was going to be the best meal I had in SF. I went out to dinner ready for steak but prime rib is not steak as far as I'm concerned. Fairly undercooked, relatively fatty, and the word "carve" is involved... it's a slab of hot roast beef. I don't dislike roast beef but I want a, blackened outside, pink inside, grill marked steak. I got the City Cut and it was good, don't get me wrong. I feel House of Prime Rib serves up a good prime rib. Nothing at all wrong with it or the sides that came with it. House makes a lot of people happy every day, but they just couldn't give me what I needed. Maybe some day I'll be hungry for something like that but I'm not right now. Don't be sad House of Prime Rib, we can still be friends.</review>

	<review>Prime Rib is one of my favorite dishes, and this place did not disappoint. The service was spot on, very informative and at the end of dinner, they give you a free Polaroid of your group. When we came here a few months back, everyone in my group ordered prime rib (why would you order anything else?) and the cuts were just great. A lot of meat, not too much fat, just awesome.  They have a various selection of cuts and they all come with the traditional spinning salad, mashed potatoes (can be substituted for a baked potato) and the Yorkshire pudding. While the main components to the prime rib dinner were similar to Lawry's down in LA, I really didn't enjoy their creamed corn. It was really runny, and didn't have that wow factor that Lawry's creamed corn has. Rather than that, it was a fine meal. A must try if you're in SF. Recommendation: Prime Rib</review>

	<review>Funny how people on Yelp mentioned that HOPR is racist...it is true!!! I went there not too long ago with my buddy and his girlfriend.  My buddy made reservations for 8:20 PM.  To get seated on time, we've  checked in to HOPR  @ 7:20 PM (a whole fucking hour early), so that we will get seated appropriately.  As 8:20 PM came around, we asked the hostess when we'll be seated, and she said shortly.  As I took a glance around the place, I noticed several tables unused, and I asked her if she could stuff us 3 into the smaller tables, but she said that the aisles need to be completely cleared for safety.  Okay, I understand her point on that, and she stated that we'll be in a booth.   As 9:10 PM came around, we were finally seated in the back room, in the comfy booths.  We asked the Junior Maitre d (the person who escorted us to our table) why was the wait so long?!  The SOB had to be rude and say, " you didn't even wait that long, plus it is a busy night."  My buddy's girlfriend then argued back that we made reservation and arrived here early to be seated at 8:30 PM, but the Junior Maitre d had to be an ASSHOLE and brushed us off.   Okay, we didn't want to make our night turn sour.  We let that SOB (Maitre d) have it his way, so we can enjoy some good food.  Anyhow, the food took an additional 45 minutes to get to our table.  I was ready to eat our waitress up, who was chit-chatting with other workers.  My freak-in stomach was in pain from overdosing on OJ.  My buddy and his girl were fired up from the worst service ever. My buddy must have ate up 12 rolls of bread. The people around us were all complaining how the service was really bad, and one person decided to tip a dollar!   When we finally got our food, we were happy.  The food was good, but the service was HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!  My buddy and his girl wanted to talk to the manager (Senior Maitre d) about the service.  They just wanted to point out that HOPR need to improve on there service (especially the Junior maitre d's attitude), but instead, the Senior Maitre d had to argue back with us...what kind of shit is that?!  Once he started making us feel inferior to him and stating that they operated in a high quality fashion. My buddy's girlfriend started asking questions about the wait to be seated, which he replied, " 45 mins is the amount of time that anyone with reservation will be seated." We gave him points on that.  The Senior Maitre d was so confidence about his reply that he brushed us off until we had another question.  We asked him how long does it take for or food to be served? And he replied, "20minutes."  Yes, now he is fucked over!!!!!  We told him that we waited 45 plus minutes for our food.  Plus, he made a fuck-in big scene around our area that people agreed with us because they too had the worst service that night.   Fast forward:  The Senior Maitre d apologized and gave sh*t to his entire staff, including the Junior Maitre d.  Our waitress was crying and apologized to us, but we told her it wasn't her fault, it was the Junior Maitre d that reuined our night at teh beggining.  The Junior Maitre d was embarrass as the Senior shouted at him publicly.  The whole entire staff started kissing our ass and gave us dessert that we profusely refused, since this is about the moral of the story ; )  The Junior Maitre d also apologized to us, but we said the damage was already done. In regards about HOPR being racist, during that night, I noticed in our surrounding area that we were (in the backroom ) with other customers that were none white.  And when I glanced in the main room, I noticed the room was bright white with Caucasians (about 97%).  Ummm...tell me if this is a conspiracy or not, but through my eyes, I am not making this up. Well, I shall shut up now.  Until HOPR changes their service, I shall put my money else where, where I'll be treated fairly.</review>

	<review>I haven't been here in years, but the MEAT definitely made an impression on me.  It was seriously some of the best beef I've had in my life.  I never order prime rib anywhere else because even at good steakhouses, it will come out rubbery and unappetizing.  I used to prefer my beef well done (now I can appreciate the red) so I was amazed that even the well done prime rib at HOPR was tender, moist, and oh so flavorful.   I remember even with the reservation for 8, we waited 45 minutes. Prime rib's on my mind since I made a 10 pounder for the first time on Xmas Eve.  It was easy, cost a fraction of the price, and tasted AMAZING.  But HOPR would still be my go to restaurant for meat!</review>

	<review>Way over rated, I make better prime from Safeway.  The service and elegance of the place is really nice.  Definitely a good place to take a date if you want to impress her but as for the food, I give it 2 stars.  Do not go here if you are looking for a great prime rib because tis simply not great, its just ok.   For the price they should really have a better tasting prime rib! thats all I'm saying.</review>

	<review>The most overrated prime rib I have ever had.  My friend's patient recommended this place.  First off we had reservations and still had to wait a good 30 minutes for our table to be ready.  The restaurant itself wasn't nicely decorated and reminded me of a sub par Italian place.  The prime rib wasn't tender and the cut of beef was not that great.  My prime rib was overcooked in certain places also.  The sides were nothing to scream about and the wine suggested wasn't good.  If you want prime rib nearby that area, go to Izzy's steakhouse.  Very disappointed with the service and food.  I would not recommend this place to friends and probably would not come back.  Usually I give places a second chance, but I was so disappointed.</review>

	<review>This place is definitely one of the best prime rib/steak places I've had. The meat is seasoned just right....not too salty and not too strong to shadow the flavor of the meat. The service is great, although it was a slow night. The biggest perk is you get free seconds on steak. Even though the seconds is a thin slice of rib, it still beats nothing. The only thing holding it back from a 5 star is the price. I spent about $100 on the dinner for me and my gf...not the most expensive dinner places, but definitely not cheap either.</review>

	<review>I think this place is way over rated. Yes, the meat is tender and very tasty but it's not such a big deal. Maybe it's because I'm not such a big meat eater. Last time I was there the meat was a little on the rough side. I do love their salad. My husband and I treated another couple and we spent over $300 for just 4 people. I think this place is way to expensive, not to mention their drinks are weak and very pricey as well. I much rather go to Espetus and spend my money there.</review>

	<review>I came here with the fellow founding members of the Yelp Meat Club for our inaugural meeting. We all had the prime rib, some had the King cut, others the House, but I believe we all came away impressed with it overall.   Our server Johnny was awesome, super professional and always willing to chime in with a quick one liner or suggestions for our meal.   I was not terribly impressed with the sides (mashed and creamed spinach) but its not that big of a deal because you are really there for the prime rib.  Big Dubbers (Willie R.) and I opted for the complimentary seconds, which I got about 3 bites into and realized I had made a huge mistake.   Overall, good old school (prime rib only) steakhouse with an impressive wine list and excellent service.</review>

	<review>Can't go wrong with House of Prime Rib for Hubby's Birthday! We hit some traffic on the way and just made our reservation. (DO MAKE RESERVATIONS!! Especially on Mother's Day weekend! Seriously!)  Thank goodness for the $8 Valet right out front.   I loved that as I walked up to the hostess I heard a family complain that they have been there for almost an hour waiting. Gave my name, was told to just wait a few mintues and as I walked over to Hubby our name was called and we were guided to our table! HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA  SUCKERS!  That right there was an awesome feeling! Our waiter was Dennis.  Super nice guy, not a hovering waiter but made sure we were taken care of during the entire meal.   Hubby ordered a Rum &amp; Coke and I could smell it across the table it was so strong.  Mostly Rum and a thimble of Coke!  He was happy!  I has a Kiddie Cocktail - Shirley Temple. :) Yum. Salad - the usual Spin by the table.  It's the only time I eat Beet's and only because its cut up small and drenched in their house dressing.  Still good, but I didn't eat all of it because I wanted to eat my meat!   Hubby got the King Henry or was it Aurthur cut?  I don't remember the name but it was the Manly Size!  Crazy large cut of Prime Rib I have ever seen. He also got the usual Creamed Spinach and Yorkshire Pudding and Loaded baked potato (they add all the condiments for you at the table)  He loved all of it and even got SECONDS on Prime Rib!  I do not know how he does it or where he packs on the food! I got the House Cut with the bone (which was going to be a treat for my dog Georgie)  I also got  Creamed Corn - good but such a small serving compared to the Spinach!  The Au Jus soaked Pudding was fantastic! I ate all my sides and saved a nice bit of the Prime Rib for Georgie.   Old School atmosphere, can get loud depending on what room they put you in, excellent service and outstanding food! I wonder who orders the fish???</review>

	<review>I know there are TONS of steak houses around in SF that I still need to check out, but soo far... House of Prime Rib is the best so far!  It is a little pricey so the only times I come here is for birthday celebrations.  The prices jumped up at least $10 per cut within the past 2-3 years.  It's a very nice restaurant with both tables and booths.  There is a full bar near the front and some high top tables you can sit and drink while waiting for your table. There is about 4 different cuts of prime rib, depending on how thick you want it.  I normally get the CITY CUT, the smallest one, because I'm not that big of a meat eater.  My boyfriend however always gets the KING HENRY VIII.  Now that is one big hunk of meat.  Regardless of what cut you order, the prime rib is soft, and tender, and juicy... DELICIOUS! The way it's served is that the WHOLE piece of prime rib is pushed around in a cart, to keep all the succulent juices inside, and they go table to table, cutting off the your piece of steak accordingly.  You even get seconds here!  But you do not get your seconds unless you're completely done with your first piece and its a very thin slice of seconds.  I been told before that they don't allow you to bring the seconds to go.  I don't understand why not... but never came across that because I always bring my first piece to go and just lay any remaining seconds ontop. For sides, you get bread, salad, yorkshire pudding, mash potatoes or baked potatoes, and creamed spinach.  I can probably just sit there and just eat the bread. I cannot remember what is in the salad except for lettuce, red beets, and cheese, but there is many things in that salad and they bring it all in a big bowl on top of ice and spin/toss the salad infront of you.  I love the yorkshire pudding, which is more like a crepe.  It's good when its crispy, and also when you soak up the wonderful juice from the prime rib.  The mash potatoes are soft and fluffy. Nice restaurant, good service, and excellent prime rib!</review>

	<review>Mmmmm meat, do not come here if you do not love meat!  My very preggy sister was craving meat and potatoes, so I knew we'd have to come here to enjoy a meal after hearing so many people rave about it. We both came here on a empty stomach and both had to waddle out of here after our meal.  Everything was pretty tasty, both her and I got the  English cut with the creamed spinach and mashed potatoes.  Only thing I didn't care for was that pudding stuff which I do agree tastes like paper.  However, there was so much food on my plate that it didn't bother me much, everything was delicious!</review>

	<review>If you couldn't tell from the other THOUSANDS of reviews, this place is a classic. It's got the old SF steakhouse feel and delicious food for a decent price. My boyfriend and I went for his birthday and we both splurged and got the Henry the VIII cut (x-large, bone-in prime rib). Between the two of us, we also got all the various sides. As expected, it was absolutely delicious. Getting the second slice was a great bonus. We had brought a bottle of wine, and corkage was $25. I had made reservations 2 weeks previous for a Friday night 7:30p seating for 2, and had been told that that was the last reservation for that day. They don't reserve all their seats, but if you have a larger party or want to make sure you're sat promptly, be sure to call well in advance. I took away a star because last time I went (which was probably when I was in middle school, so 15 years ago...) I remember the second slice being the same portion size as the original, and our second slice was fairly small. Also, our server was a little inattentive and we had to wait awhile between courses. He also failed to realize that with a bottle of wine from 1988, you have to be more gentle than normal with the cork, so he broke it while he was pulling it out. However, he was able to get it all out and he strained and decanted it.</review>

	<review>Once again I went to House of Prime Rib and eat dinner again. As always I enjoy every moment I was there. Great customer service. I purposely dress like a little punk to walk in there but they still treat me as an adult. I was surprise and when I order a glass of wine the waiter was suprise about my age too but anyhow their Prime Rib is great very juicy and the bread is soft. Always have good selection of wine bake potatoes yum yum yum. I don't know what else to say. I will upload some picture and you tell me if is good or not.</review>

	<review>In the last 5+ years, I have frequented House of Prime Rib at least 1- 2/ year. My first experience there was ok. The food was pretty good, but the service was crap. It was nice and cordial up until our waiter was rude to two of us. I didn't plan on coming back after this visit. I returned to House of Prime Rib for my boyfriend's buddy's birthday. The food was consistently good (as in exactly the same) and the service was MUCH better. Our waiter was wonderful and pleasant. My next visit was once again very pleasant and the food was once more very good. The menu is limited so it's not a place I could come back to often. You get your spinach, bread pudding, mashed or baked potatoes with your choice of prime rib slice. Of ocurse bread and salad come complimentary at the start of the meal and the wine selection is pretty good although they didn't have our original choice, we were happy nonetheless. Ah, another visit for some pretty good prime rib at a pretty good price. This time they mixed our salad in a big bowl in front of us. We were all given a serving from the same big bowl. One of us found a bug. I suppose it's normal to find bugs on produce, but we'd assume they would have cleaned them off before serving us. The waiter hardly seemed shocked, but he switched out that ONE salad... the rest of us just stopped eating ours. I actually adore their salads because I love beets and they have sliced beets in their salads, which is a delicious addition to most salads! :) Generally speaking, the food isn't anything to call home about, but it's pretty good and compared to other higher end steakhouses, the House of Prime Rib is decentyl priced. I think your experience in the end comes down to your waiter/ waitress because the food is consistently good. House or Prime Rib gets: A+ for consistency A  for pricing/ food quality B  for service Parking is valet (it's SF- what else?) Even with a reservation, there has always been a wait (short and long).</review>

	<review>Vibe: Classy and celebratory (lots of happy birthdays being sung). Food: Very satisfying and filling, though not the greatest presentation. Go with the mashed potatoes and creamed spinach for your accompaniments, they're WAY better than the baked potato and corn, respectively. Also, medium-rare is the best way to order your prime rib. Service: Outstanding--great suggestions and regular check-ins. Value: For only really special occasions and for someone who loves meat. Otherwise, it's really pricey and you could do better.</review>

	<review>Here's the menu: Prime Rib. tasty, done rare, medium, or well done. Cream Corn, Cream Spinach, Potato: Baked or Mashed, Salad creamed in Thousand Island Dressing, and Yorkshire pudding to soak up the cream. Simple, and perfect if you're missing your mid-western homey-ness.   For $200+ for 4 folks, I think there are better restaurants in town.  But I enjoyed the dinner, cuz I was with my best buddies and the food settled well in my tummy.  If you've got a meat and taters person in your group, they'll love this place.</review>

	<review>There is nothing wrong with meat, meat, and more meat. House of Prime Rib makes everything perfect! On my last visit, I came here to celebrate my college housemate V's birthday. We were promptly seated in a booth, which was kind of snug but only made the gathering more intimate. The guys all got the House of Prime Rib cut and the King Henry VIII cut, which I decided to try something new, the English Cut, which is way different from my usual order of a City Cut. We also ordered drinks and our amazing server got the bar to whip us up some really fruity rum punches! (The birthday boy likes really fruity drinks with the least amount of alcohol possible...) As usual, the salad was exquisite. I love the beets in the salad since it gives such a good contrast in flavor and texture. Their dressing is of course amazing as well. Then we got OUR MEAT! The guys loved their meat. Who doesn't like a big chunk of meat?! Mine was definitely different since the meat was very very thinly sliced. I honestly prefer a chunk of meat than slices because I like the possibility of using my food as a weapon in case I ever get attacked. Throwing a slice of meat at someone won't hurt as much as throwing a nice 12 oz prime rib. :) We all got sides of creamed corn and spinach, mashed potatoes, and baked potatoes. I LOVE their creamed corn, but the guys LOVED their spinach because of all the bacon in it.  I brought my baked potato back home since I never finish it and it was great the next day too! Everyone also got seconds for their meat, and of course it was DEMOLISHED. Since it was our friend's birthday, we all decided to order dessert to end our meal on a sweet and happy note. We ordered the Creme Brulee, Tiramisu, Peach Melba, and the English Trifle. My favorite was definitely a tie between the Creme Brulee and the English Trifle. The Creme Brulee was caramelized to perfection and the custard underneath was perfectly sweet. On the other hand, the English Trifle had fresh berries, layers of whipped cream, a nice pound cake, and LOTS OF Grand Marnier! It's safe to say that House of Prime Rib is definitely a SF institution as proclaimed over and over again by Anthony Bourdain. I'll always come back here for a good meal and good times.</review>

	<review>Yes I finally found a place that really deserves a bad review.  I was contemplating this for a while.   The great HOPR you get the first bad review from Hen.   How do we start.  Ive been coming here for over 15 years maybe 20,  the food hasnt changed much.  Still pretty good overall.  I like the English cut, thin with as many seconds as I can get.  Great creamed spinach.  Get this though,  Ive noticed major changes in the racial profiling going on there.  Im a Korean San Franciscan, no hiding that, and I never sit in the front room.  I always have to wait hella long there even with reservations.  The people walking around with the meat thingies giving you cuts are not that cool anymore.   They talked shit to my chinese friend Warren's parents,  these are 60 year old people with more history in SF than anyone working there.  This place needs to take their heads out of their asses, cause theyre not that special.  All in all You Suck.  That sucks that I have to lose out on good prime rib because of racism.  Clean up your act.  Oh if you're not asian this place might be OK for you.  If you're not asian Five stars. Sad isnt it.</review>

	<review>Food: The food is great. When you order you Prime Rib the guy comes around to your table and cuts it right there. I have never had Prime Rib this juicy at any other restaurant I've been to. Parking: The parking is easy because they have valet or you can park yourself in the lot on the corner right near the restaurant. I have never spent more than 5 minutes looking for parking. Staff: The service is great and the staff is friendly. Price: Reasonable, actually if you're thinking of what you get it's VERY cheap, but if you're thinking about compared to others it's reasonable. Usually about $20-$40 per person depends on what you order and this is not including alcohol.   Atmosphere: Little noisy, if you're on a date and want something quiet and romantic this isn't the place. If you're looking for great food and a great price, this is your spot. I've taken dates here and it's always went over well. With the atmosphere you won't ever have an uncomfortable silence.</review>

	<review>Star: 3.5 Salad - REALLY GOOD. I like the serving size. I don't even know what they put in there but every bite is really good. House of Prime Rib Cut - it's tender and juicy, and very soft. We asked for medium rare but everything looks rare. I like the sides of horseradishes, it went well with the prime rib, delicious! Sides - Mashed potatoes: It wasn't particularly very memorable. It tasted like mashed potatoes but it was good. - Creamed spinach: I like the texture and there's little bits of bacon in it. - Bread: warm and yummy. - Cornbread: unique because it's in the shape of a corn but slightly dry. - Creamed corn: Ehh. Service: Our waitress was incredibly nice and kind. Amazing experience! We were seated at such a large table for four of us. Great service! Overall, if you have a good cut of prime rib, come here.</review>

	<review>Its funny.  For me for the longest time I always heard how great skiing was.  So finally after many years of hearing about it I finally get a chance to go.  Yes, the first time out on the slopes, a momentous occasion.  But when I look back on that first time I don't remember the lessons or flying down the hill or the cold hard falls.  I only remember the few minutes I spent each morning in the hotel hallway chatting with this one girl I had a crush on for so long.  Nothing to do with skiing, only breakfast pastries, bandaids and small talk. Flash forward to the House of Prime Rib.  They call it HOPR.  A great meat place in SF.  Where meat lovers meet for meat.  You gotta try this place people say.  What, you haven't been there people say.  Finally after two years I go. The prime rib is indeed good.  A nice juicy piece of meat served with some cheesy creamed spinach and a baked potato with the works.  You can have creamed corn, which I hear isn't so great, and mashed potatoes if that's your preference.  The salad is nice too.  And if you finish all your food yeah you can have dessert, but even better, you can have a little bit more meat and another side.  But guard your potato and bread if you still want it because they will whisk it away.  Service is friendly and attentive without being obstrusive.  I like that they decant your wine.  And offer 2 creamy horseradish options in addition to the normal full strength horseradish, which btw will clear your sinuses so handle with care. But looking back at my first experience at HOPR the thing I remember most, more than the good food, is the little things in their service.  I like how they take care of the gals first.  The servers will go out of their way to walk around to the women at the table first to take their orders, to refill their wine glasses, to serve the food.  Now that's something small but something special.  That's the cherry on the sundae.  That's two minutes in the hotel hallway with that special gal.  And that's what separates HOPR from just another meat joint.</review>

	<review>Me likee.  Food- mmm good.  Atmosphere- ok, a little loud but that means it's busy which is a good sign.  Service- excellent.   More about the food.  The salad is surprisingly good conidering this is a steak houes.  The steak is very tasty and they like to leave you satisfied... if you're ever still hungry just ask for more.  A nice touch.  Yorkshire, potato, corn, and creamed spinach are the standard sides.  Nothing special to report on these, but all decent.</review>

	<review>Having long heard of HOPR's reputation, I now understand what the hype is all about: HOPR's spirit and ambience. The draw here is decidedly not the food. Though not bad, the somewhat average prime rib and fare benefit greatly from the singular old school atmosphere and service provided by dark wood paneled walls, old fashioned furniture, and white linen service (complete with chilled forks). Even so, I would not have enjoyed my meal at HOPR so much without the spirited company of roughly twenty friends. As for the food, the portion sizes lived up to the hype: plentiful salad, sides, yorkshire pudding, and a gigantic "King Henry" slab of prime rib with a rib bone. But for all the hype, I was disappointed by the overly well-done patches in my medium-rare order, which amounted to tender but inconsistent prime rib. This may sound sacrilegious, but I've had better and more consistent prime rib at Lawry's (Chicago and Dallas) and Broadway Prime (Burlingame). Still, if you are looking for a venue for fraternal bonding over carnivorous cuisine, HOPR is hard to be beat.</review>

	<review>Make a reservation! We waited almost 2 hours. I can't believe I did it, but I did. Don't worry they have a nice sized waiting area reminiscent of a high end English pub.  After the long wait we were seated around 10:15pm. So this is the house of prime rib, so folks that's all they have...and "fresh fish." With that said, this was some of the best prime I ever had. I give it a three simply because of lack of options. While that may seem silly for a place with this name, it's my review and I can do what I want.</review>

	<review>I love eating here.  The ambiance is nice and the food is awesome.  You actually feel like you're eating at someone's mansion when you're here.  Probably the best prime rib and they serve yorkshire pudding.  They even serve second helpings!  Hell, I even had to stop myself from eating too much salad because it was good.  Can I say anymore good things about this place before you give it a go?  Remember to make reservations... Van The Man's must try : The King Arthur's cut</review>

	<review>This is one of those "Been there, done that" kind of places.... Yes, you should go, because when you meet people who just LOVE this place, then well you'll know what they are talking about...and should I dare say you'll know what kind of food they like and avoid any other restaurant recommendations in the future. for the money? not very good quality. to sum it up...a bunch of wannabe's eating at a place they think is all nice, when really its just commercialized, expensive, and like 70's cheesy!</review>

	<review>I can't believe I've never reviewed this place. This is one of my favorite restaurants and it's my bf's favorite. I love this place! I came here the other day with a party of 12 on a Saturday night and they accommodated us even though they supposedly cap at 10 people  Fri-Sundays. I've been here a dozen of times and the wait staff is always so friendly and awesome. We had a reservation for at 6:30 and was seated at 6:45 which isn't too bad. This is the only American restaurant that my mom has actually liked (being Chinese and super picky). My relatives from Asia loved this place as well. The kids meals are pretty good, for $12 it almost looks like the City Cut. My dad got the Tilapia and he said was pretty good. If you order the  HOPR or King Henry cut they give you a sliver of 2nds as well as 2nds on the sides which is pretty cool. You must get a reservation for this place no matter what day of week. I once came here on a Tuesday night thinking it'd be slow and since we only had a party of 2, we got there at 7 and was not seated until 9...! Anyway this place is the best, a must try!</review>

	<review>My girlfriend took me here for my birthday and everything was perfect! The service was superb!  Our waitress was friendly, inviting, attentive, and knowledgable. The salad was amazing!  (and I'm not really a salad person)  The dressing was a cross between thousand island and raspberry vinaigrette. They used a wine pitcher for the Cabernet we brought which went beautifully with the main course.  I particularly liked this attention to detail. I ordered the King Henry VIII Cut, Rare with mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.  {Hands down the best steak I have ever had.} The steak was HUGE and very satisfying.  Since it was my birthday, I went ahead and got a second cut and finished off my friend's second cut. For desert, we ordered the crème brulée which was about as good as it gets.  They surprised me with the birthday singing and ice cream which was also nice. All in all, a perfect evening.</review>

	<review>i was really looking forward to this acclaimed prime rib place, the so-called lawry's of norcal.  i know lawry's, and this place is NO lawry's. first, the wait was painfully long (2+) hours.  i've never waited this long at any place before. then, i get the prime rib.  it was okay.  the real seller of this place was that you could get more if you wanted.  i waited 45 minutes for another cut and was it a thin slice.  imagine mickey and the bean stalk when they cut a piece of bread or a bean so thin that you could see through it.  the wait was because there was a large party, or some excuse like that.   if you like prime rib and thought this was the bomb, you need to get your butt to lawry's.  meatballs and potato chips while you wait, spinning salad bowl with nice slivers of hard boiled egg, and the best damn creamed corn you will ever have.  this place pails in comparison. also, they happened to close every single entrance to the bay bridge out of san francisco that night except for one.  on a saturday.  yeah, good times...</review>

	<review>I had really high hopes for this place, that's why I decided to beg my family to shell out all their dough to take me here for my graduation dinner. Let's make this short and sweet: :) +warm sourdough bread +Prime rib cut at your table, and tasty +Spicy horseradish + Nice enviroment :( -Rude-ish waitress that was completely useless until the bill came and she kissed ass for a tip, no thanks, ew - Waiting until I was almost finished eating to get my drink - mediocre mashed potatoes -so-so creamed corn This isn't to say I wouldn't come back, the prime rib was AWESOME, however, for the price, I certainly wouldn't recommend this as 100 percent great. Just so-so great</review>

	<review>A very San Francisco Place!! If you love beef and prime rib, this and Lawry's are the place to dine at.  The meat is melt in your mouth and the bread and cream spinach and corn are excellent. The Prime Rib is wheeled out in a silver cart and they will cut the meat to your specifications. I am not a salad eater but my family is and they said the salad was good and the salad is huge. The flavor to the Prime Rib is well seasoned and taste excellent with or with out au jus. If you are still hungry, the server will cut you a small slice for you to enjoy, which will in deed fill you up. Price is $$$</review>

	<review>I arrived 5 minutes prior to my 8pm reservation, yet we weren't seated until 8.15pm which is AFTER I asked again about the status of our reservation. This was a Monday night so I can imagine other days could be even worse. Completely unacceptable for a place where you drop $100+ for 2. Place was very busy, decor was very similar as what is shown in pictures. Now to get to the food and service. Our waiter, while with a great attitude wasn't very attending... he didn't check on us and or refill the water, and it took some time to get a hold of him for the check. so 3/5 for that. Now to the food. The salad was amazing... 5/5 The sides were alright nothing to brag about... just various potato (choices)  prepared in the same way as say IHOP would do it. 3/5 The Beef... Well kind of mixed about that... it was good, but it wasn't great. Perhaps I came in with high expectations... I got the King Henry the VIIIs cut the girl got the Prime Rib cut, I didn't notice a size difference although the King Henry was supposed to be bigger. The waiter did ask at the end whether I wanted another slice... which is not something you get anywhere else... so 4/5 So overall I came in with high expectations due to the overwhelming positive reviews... yet I left with mixed feelings, therefore 3/5.</review>

	<review>When you name your restaurant after the only thing on your menu, it better be damn good. My fiance and I were in town on vacation and we had seen the restaurant on Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations. So we made sure to make our reservations about a week in advance. We both absolutely loved our meals and experience. We both ordered our cuts medium and they were cooked just right. The gravy on the mashed potatoes and au juis are tasty. Everything else you get was great too. Service was attentive and delightful...and the decor was like stepping into someone's old school mansion. For $30-40 you get your money's worth in my opinion since you get a salad and 4 sides (cornbread, yorkshire pudding, choice of creamed spinach or creamed corn, and a baked potato or mashed potatoes) with your cut of meat. It was delicious and I wish we had one in Chicago!</review>

	<review>Let me  preface this by saying I am a REALLY picky meat eater. When I buy chicken to cook, I end up having to purchase double the amount because I cut off more than half because they are "gross" parts. So I didn't like AT ALL that they brought over this huge hunk of beef to the table. The pre-meat sides were just mediocre, and I thought the decor was bad. How is this place so popular?</review>

	<review>I went to House of Prime Rib for a birthday dinner last night for 10 people. It was my best friends 21st birthday, so I had a couple special requests to make. Anyways, here is my breakdown of the evening: When we arrived, the rest of our party was waiting for us. Unfortunately, WE arrived almost an hour late (family genes). They seated us almost 5 minutes after we arrived (+!). Despite the fact that everyone was meeting each other, hugging and some of the women already drinking, they waited semi-patiently for us. (rude of us not to just get going to the table considering we all stopped eating that day for this meal). I will admit, however, that the table setting was crowded. We had all this silverware and three different glasses, three small centerpieces and bottles of wine (we ordered that, but still). With the gigantic menu, I felt squished. I'm going to backtrack just a little-- when I went to the coat check, I believe I spoke to the Maitre'd, and I informed him that I had a special surprise dessert prepared for my friend I wanted to come out at dinner. They had valet bring the dessert from the car and had it out with a candle in it, and presented beautifully just the way I asked when it was time. I had heard this place wasn't up to par on the special requests, but seriously, all I did was ask nicely. They were so incredibly helpful and for that recieved 4 stars. (especially since this was on an incredibly busy and crowded friday night.) Onto the food: The bread was good, but too crusty on the outside. The cornbread was a little cold, but still good. The salad was fanTASTIC. I loved how all those flavors came together harmoniously and there was that hint of pepper in there that everyone trys to replicate but can't. I don't normally like beets, but this was done well. Ahem--I must apologize, as even though it is called the House of Prime Rib, I ordered the swordfish. ::hand slap::. Hey now, swordfish happens to be my favorite and also tastes like steak. Plus, massive portions of meat like that makes my tummy hurt. Despite, the fish was fabulous and the creamed corn was tasty. I am not a fan of spinach, so I cannot say whether or not I liked it, but it didn't look very appetizing. The Yorkshire Pudding looked and tasted like a Dutch Pancake, something I make all the time so without the lemon and syrup it was so-so to me. I did not get a mashed or baked potato because that would have been too much food...but it was good according to my friend. The dessert was our own, but still they were able to present it fabulously. Thank you!! I want to touch on our server--from what I read on the review before me, I must have gotten lucky because he was awesome, patient, and didn't mind that no one was paying attention to him when he made the salad (I was though; I used to be a server so I know how that feels haha). I did not catch his name to give him this praise but hopefully whomever reads this at the restaurant would remember the dessert request and tell him I said thank you. (side note: their wine selection is wonderful). I give 4 stars instead of 5 because of the food itself. I saw the menu prices and it was expensive...from a person who gets food cooked by chef friends, they charge less for a better plate. Next time I attend (which will be again, next year, same time), I will try the steak, I promise. :)</review>

	<review>Definitely make reservations, and even if you show up early, be prepared to wait because they will not seat you until your reservation time.   The food here was decent... not the best prime rib I've had, but pretty good.  My wife had the "City" cut, while I had the "Henry VIII" (I finished it!).  Our server, Jennifer, was awesome.   Worth a visit if you're in town.</review>

	<review>I made reservation here yesterday for my boyfriend's birthday and the service was excellent! RIght when we arrive at HOPR, we were seated within seconds. No wait, even if you have reservation. Usually when I book a reservation for other restaurants, I would be told for a table to be cleared. But here, nope! :) The food was top notch! The waiters were very friendly, and gave the best service I've experienced. One elderly guy would walk around to check on each table to see if their dinner is going great, which I thought it nice. All I need to say is good food and good customer service.</review>

	<review>My man loves meat! I brought him here to celebrate our Anniversary we did not have a reservation but were able to get right in.  The moment you walk in you can smell the delicious aroma of beef!  The menu is simple because they do one thing right and that is they make the Best Prime Rib in town!  The prime rib just melts in your mouth.  My man was in a meat coma when we left. Service, atmosphere, food all deserves 5 stars in my book.  We will be back!</review>

	<review>This place is ridiculous (in a good way.)  The waiter said as we ordered "Let the gluttony begin."  My boyfriend was in heaven!! The food was a feast! They slice the prime rib in front of you in an old fashioned carving station.  We both got mashed potatoes. They were delicious.  I love creamed spinach so I got that.  My boyfriend got the corn.  i actually liked the corn better.  I kept stealing bites.  The horseradish sauces were all delicious.  There were several kinds.  I loved them all.   The service was excellent, but not pretentious.  Everyone was really friendly from the bartender, waiter, to host.  While we were in the bar area we spoke with a couple servers and they were all friendly and seemed happy and helpful. After our meal my boyfriend went to use the restroom and the waiter cleared our plates and asked if we were ready for another piece of prime rib.  I laughed because I assumed he was joking and told him no.  He brought my boyfriend another piece anyways and he ate it!!! I loved this place so much.  It was amazing! Do not go if you don't eat meat!  They do have a fish on the menu, but really???</review>

	<review>My boyfriend and I came here for my birthday, which for me is a big deal. I picked the House of Prime Rib as my restaurant of choice because it's an SF classic. Neither of us had been there and we were both excited about it. Needless to say our experience was lackluster. All of the food tasted good but the price of the food vs. the quality of food is just sad. The food comes in this silver dome cart thing. They slice off a thin piece of meat and basically pour hot sauce over it to cook it. The sides were all mushy. The mashed potatoes were smooth to the point that they seemed reconstituted and the vegetable options are over cooked cream of spinach or creamed corn; all of which have been pre-cooked and kept warm on the cart. Although our server was excellent, the hostess failed to tell him that it was my birthday and my boyfriend had to awkwardly bring it up in front of me. Especially disappointing because my boyfriend had called ahead to let them know, so that I would be surprised. To top it off the birthday dessert was especially underwhelming, a small scoop of vanilla bean ice cream to share. Really?! We paid for a 2 star meal at a 4 star price. Wish I would have gone to a chain steak house restaurant instead.</review>

	<review>Amazing prime ribs. Regardless of the cut, our meats came out tender and succulent. Every bite was bursting with flavors like fireworks you simply don't want it to end.  But.....yes, there are "buts". You know when the spot light is on the prime ribs, that seems to be the only focus and nothing else? I find the sides such as the creamed spinach and creamed corn lacking some care. I have had amazing gourmet sides at Steakhouses and I felt House of Prime Ribs fell short. The quality of the sides was a hit and miss. The baked potato and Yorkshire pudding were amazing though. Another miss is the service. Our reservation was 7pm. The restaurant was packed. The staff was busy doing their best serving all the customers. Because of that  I felt the service was minimal. We, a party of four, weren't treated with disrespect but the staff had a "hurry up devouring the meats and get the f*ck out" look. As my first time dining here I had a lot of fun watching people and seeing the salad being spun and tossed, and seeing the glorious slabs of meat being cut in front of my eyes. It was fun, but I don't think I would return any time soon.</review>

	<review>This place is amazing! You HAVE TO make reservations like 2 weeks ahead if you want to eat here on the weekends. It's very classy and has this amazing social atmosphere. As you're waiting, cocktails are served with rice crackers. Once you're seated, you are constantly taken care of. The servers are all trained to make a salad so cool! I got the city cut last time and it was delicious!!! There is endless re-fills on your preferred cut. The margaritas and chardonnay were fabulous as well! Lots of parking on nearby streets.</review>

	<review>Um wow. This place serves the most delicious meat I've ever tasted. I always like mine done medium rare and man do they know how to make it. Of course, the amazing meat comes at a steep price but it's a great treat if you're willing to dish out the money. I've been here twice and both times have been a great experience for me. The service is fabulous. All the hosts and waiters are very friendly and attentive. As an avid lover of meat, I always go for the biggest cut of meat and the King Henry VIII cut definitely fits my appetite for steak. This cut is extremely generous and it just melts in your mouth. Along with the meat, everyone gets served some bread, salad, potato (mashed or baked), and yorkshire pudding. Everything is very tasty, though I haven't quite gotten used to the egginess of the yorkshire pudding. RANDOM TIP: The last time I went we had made a reservation for 9:30pm and since it's so close to their closing time, they are actually willing to serve you extra slices of meat because they need to get rid of it. So go late! That way you can even take some home to enjoy the next day! Overall, this place is one of my favorite restaurants. I am definitely coming back as many times as I can before I die.</review>

	<review>Very disappointed with this place after reading all the reviews.  My wife and I were visiting San Fran and love prime rib.  The sides were horrible and lacking in taste (and so was the salad). The prime rib was so bland we were both reaching for the salt and pepper shakers.  We both left unsatisfied. The bright spot of the visit was the service - it was excellent.</review>

	<review>Came here for dinner the other night for a friend's bday after swearing to myself that i would never come here again.  Had really poor customer service in the past.  I'm glad to report that the service was great the other night.  My meat was cooked perfectly ( i always order rare), corn bread was good and baked potato was decent.  However, all of us on the table was joking about the size of our portions.  I'm sure the economy has hit a lot of restaurants but i actually left the restaurant still hungry.  I ordered the House cut and was almost embarrassed to ask my waiter if they mistaken my order for the child's meal.  I didn't really care cuz i remember in the past they would serve you more meat if you could eat it, they just didn't want you taking anything home if you asked for more.  So i destroyed my small child's portion and asked my waiter for another piece.  He said "no problem" and brought me out another piece.  This second piece seriously was like a slice of deli meat.  I literally could have rolled it up and ate it in one bite.  We all just laughed and said that they'd have to "keep them coming".  Next thing i know the bus boy is taking my plate away.  I tried to stop him telling him i was gonna ask for more meat.  He informed me that two pieces is the limit.  I was shocked and still hungry.  I continued the night by drinking tons of water, wine, and eating bread.  Food quality was good and service was great....but portion size is pretty pathetic.  If i'm gonna spend that kind of money, i would want to leave the restaurant full especially after eating a monster salad, bread, corn bread, creamed spinach, and york pudding.....</review>

	<review>Had been going to Broadway Prime recently and though the meats were hit and miss, it had been a good substitute for House of Prime Rib. Well, we just went to HOPR and let me tell you, no more Broadway Prime! Now, I am no meat-alogist, but the meat was perfect. I usually order the City Cut (comparable to the petite cut at BP) or the English Cut (thinly sliced). But,  I found the portion a bit more generous and very flavorful and tender even though it was an end piece (that's right, I order my meat WELL DONE). They have added cornbread to the meal, though I found it unnecessary  (and I love carbs!), since they already provide an ample supply of hot sourdough bread at the beginning and the Yorkshire pudding with the entree. The sides are comparable to BP, but the quality of the meat is head and shoulders above. Prices $32 for the city cut (smallest)  to $38 for the king henry cut (largest and almost guarantees a doggie bag). The only minor thing is the wait.  Even with a reservation (unless you have the first seating), you will have to wait at least 30 minutes. And, unless you are lucky to snag one of the bar area chairs, be prepared to stand.</review>

	<review>SF people, please come to the NW and Canada to try out The Keg. The price is mush more friendly and the prime rib is the real deal without any fancy covers. KEG -The steak juice is dripping slowly out of the meat. KEG - The meat is tasty with flavor and it will melt in your mouth without too much chewing. Visa verse, the House of Prime Rib is the other way around. I am will to pay for a slice of quality steak but not here. So, I consider this place is pr icy for it quality and service. HOUSE - The steak juice is forcing to dripping. With the Au jus poured on the dish already. It's just cheating. HOUSE - The texture of the meat is chewy. The meat is only just barely warm because it's been sitting in the "chart". HOUSE - The salad is below average quality, but the spinach is good. HOUSE - Service is only average Note: I travelled around to taste all kind of steaks no matter how popular and pricey of the restaurants. I know what is a slice of great steak/prime rib taste and look like.</review>

	<review>I GET THE MEAT SWEATS JUST THINK ABOUT THIS PLACE!!!! Prime rib here is the real deal, perfectly cooked and arrives at your table hand carved and  OMG amazingly delicious.   The sides are classics and complement the meat very well with one exception, the Yorkshire pudding which is a little too greasy and scares my arteries which are already been tested with the beef. great service full bar and refills on what is probably the best prime rib in the world.  1000 plus reviews can't be wrong.</review>

	<review>We ate there last night for the first time.  Their menu is very simple.  Prime rib in four different sizes and two fresh fish selections. The do an excellent job with prime rib.  The yorkshire pudding was cooked perfectly.  The only drawback was the noise.  Super loud restaurant.</review>

	<review>What do I have to say about this place that hasn't already been said? It is a San Francisco institution and, despite rarely going there, it remains one of my top 20 favorite restaurants. We went there last Thursday evening. Everything was just wonderful. Service, atmosphere and....ahh....the food. The best Prime Rib I've ever had. It was flavorful, tender and not very fatty. The sides, the salads, the bread- all very, very good. The owner even came by during the dinner to make sure everything was to our liking (charming!) The place is a well-oiled machine. From a restaurant management perspective, it is truly a sight to behold. Everything has been considered and perfected. From the water carafes they leave on the table to the cart-o-meat to the timeliness of the service. Everything was perfectly timed to allow for brisk table turnover, but without ever making you feel rushed. Brilliant! The ONLY complaint I have about this place is: The wine list. It's pretty limited. We often will have Argentine Malbecs with dinner and, sadly, there was only one on the list- and not a great one at that. If they could expand the list, it would truly be perfect.</review>

	<review>I really like this place. When you walk inside, you feel as if you've walked back in time. It's SO old school. The first time I went I got dressed up thinking it was going to be fancy schmancy and it "kind of" is but just as many people were wearing shorts and flip flops as they were wearing classier attire. Before I get into the food, I'm going to start with one small complaint. OK, medium complaint. I have made a reservation 3 out of the 4 times I've dined here and they never seat you right away. It's more like they seat you 20-30 minutes after you get there. I don't know if this is a ploy to get you to order drinks from the bar or what but it's somewhat annoying. OK, complaint out of the way. Now on to the FOOD. Did I mention that I was a veg for about 12 years until about ummm...3 years ago? No? OK, well I was.  I am now obsessed with meat. Yes, I said it. Could eat it every day if it wasn't for that whole, I'm trying to be healthy and live a long life bit. The food here ROCKS. For about $30 you get so much food. Meat (I prefer the thin English cut), creamed corn or spinach (spinach all the way), Yorkshire pudding, baked or mashed potatoes (the baked come with all the fixings including a pound of butter and sour cream)...oh and I haven't even mentioned the best part. THE SALAD...aka "the crack salad" as I like to call it. I don't know what they put in this salad (actually I do, MSG...it's in the seasoning that sits on the table) but the mixture of beets, cheese, egg, and the amazing salad dressing (which is all mixed at your table) is to die for. My mouth is literally watering right now. Oh and a huge chunk of warm sourdough bread and butter with a knife you could easily murder someone with is immediately put on your table when you arrive. Why am I describing this meal in reverse order? I'm tired... OMG...I almost forgot to talk about the meat. They actually have people carving your meat in front of you. It is cooked specifically to your liking (I don't get how they do that when some people want well done/others like it bloody but I'm not a meat carving expert so there you go). The meat is amazing, great quality and melts in your mouth. The horseradish sauce that they serve with it comes spicy or not spicy (a creamier version) but I like them both equally so I get both. As obsessed as I am with meat, I am even more so with horseradish sauce on meat and theirs is amazing. Oh and a little secret...you can ask for meat refills. For reals. Anyway, GO HERE. Apparently it's Anthony Bourdains favorite restaurant in the Bay Area...and he's one of my heroes/gods/I have a sick crush on him so whatever he says is gospel.</review>

	<review>1 STAR-ambiance 1 STAR-a SF tradition, steeped in a long history Minus 1 star for rushed (read:  hurried) service Minus 1 star for poor quality of steak &amp; sides Minus 1 star for 1/2 hour wait w/reservation Regrettably, I was beyond disappointed in the House of Prime Rib.  I first learned about HOPR on Check Please, Bay Area on PBS.  All three diners gave a good review to the establishment, so I couldn't wait to give it a try.  I was taken here for dinner as a late birthday present by a SF native who also swore that it was amazing.  I figured if all they served was prime rib, my absolute favorite meal, they must be REALLY good at it.  How very wrong I was. My dinner partner &amp; I had a reservation, but were made to sit in the waiting area for almost 30 minutes.  When escorted to our table, we were seated side by side, against the wall (think Parisian cafe seating), making it difficult to have any conversation without sitting sideways to look at one another.  This was awkward &amp; uncomfortable, although it has little to do with my 2 star rating.  I'm not subtracting stars for that; it was just unpleasant and annoying. Shortly after being seated, our server arrived to take our orders, &amp; then rushed away.  Moments later, he returned with the salad bowl, &amp; set about spinning the metal bowl inside the plastic bowl full of ice &amp; pouring their signature salad dressing from as far above his head as his arm could reach.  This swift &amp; exaggerated gesture was neither necessary nor professional.  It has the feel of a table side illusion that a magician might perform, only rushed &amp; somewhat frantic.  NOTE:  restaurants that lack quality will often resort to gimmicks in an attempt to distract diners from the lacking quality.   This is clearly a tactic employed here at HOPR.   I ordered the House cut medium, but it arrived medium well.  Okay, how difficult is it to get a steak order right at a steakhouse...especially when they only serve one kind.  Apparently, it is rather challenging for HOPR.  The steak was of mediocre quality.  I would rank it down there with the prime rib you get at Izzy's.  Thus, if you like Izzy's, you probably will like HOPR, although Izzy's is less expensive.  Also, there was a good portion of fat on my cut, which I chose not to eat.  When I finished the entire steak, except the gristle &amp; fat that I left on the plate, I was told that I did not qualify for the free extra cut of steak (which is supposed to be offered when one finishes their entire steak).  I was really okay with this, as the steak was of mediocre quality, but it was the principle.  Must one devour all the fat &amp; gristle &amp; then pick up the bone &amp; gnaw the remaining traces of meat off of it in order to qualify for the free cut of steak?  Again, I didn't really want it, but come on... I found their sides to be just as UNIMPRESSIVE.  The mashed potatoes tasted more like they were from out of a box rather than freshly mashed, &amp; the brown gravy tasted like it came from a jar or can.  The creamed spinach was just as ho-hum.  Sigh... Their Yorkshire pudding was fairly good, as well as the bread that came to the table while we were waiting for our salad.  Speaking of which, my dinner partner &amp; I had barely eaten three bites of salad each, when the server frantically appeared at our table asking if he could remove our salad plates &amp; bring our steaks.  The speed at which he approached made me first expect him to report that there was a fire in the kitchen &amp; we must quickly evacuate the premises.  I nodded for him to take away my salad, and without asking my dinner partner, he snatched his plate away, too, and rushed off.  It was the best part of the meal.  It was then that I knew I would have to police the servers &amp; runners, lest they run away with my steak &amp; sides.   As it happens, I spent the rest of our time at the table requesting that we be allowed to eat &amp; enjoy our meal without further attempts to take away our plates, &amp; that when we were finished, we would let them know.  I honestly have never had such brisk &amp; inconsiderate service at a steak house...or anywhere else for that matter.  It was a HUGE turn off.  If I wanted to speed eat, I could've gone through a drive-thru window somewhere &amp; eaten in my car.  At least, I would have been able to enjoy my fast food in private &amp; without interruptions. By the time we were presented with dessert menus, I was ready to leave.  Apparently, this was their intent...to turn us off so much that we wanted to leave just to avoid more hurried pestering.  Thus, their table turn-over time was maximized.  We passed on dessert, &amp; made our way to valet parking ($8). Next time I will try Harris' or, better still, the next time you are in Los Angeles, and you want an extraordinary prime rib experience, only far more upscale with higher quality meat, mashed potatoes, and creamed spinach, go to Lawry's.  Lawry's is consistently super</review>

	<review>This isn't your fancy schmancy California cuisine.  This is old school for meat lovers. We started off with drinks which seemed reasonably priced.  Our waitress was great -- this was our first visit to the House of Prime Rib so she explained the menu.  Not much to explain since all they have is prime rib (well, they offer a fish of the day, but what are you doing going here for fish?).  Actually the explanation was helpful since the menu doesn't explain the cuts well.  I say go with the largest King Henry cut -- it's only about $2 more than a medium sized cut and you won't regret it. First up was the salad.  Not your fine dining spring lettuce, this was iceberg with beets and lots of other good things.  I loved how they spun the salad bowl in a larger bowl of ice while drizzling the dressing over the salad.  The dressing wasn't anything like I expected but it was oh so delicious. The meat comes from a serving cart right in the dining room carved by the chef.  It was probably the best prime rib I've ever had.  Along with the meat came three kinds of horseradish.  I thought the medium hot horseradish was kind of bland, but mixing it with the hottest horseradish made it just right to clear the sinuses. The creamed corn was good, but the loaded baked potatoe was the best I've ever had.  It was moist and flavorful, loaded with real bacon, sour cream, and butter. We opted out for desert.  Didn't want to spoil that meat extravaganza with something sweet. All told the bill was just over $100 for two people with two drinks.  I wouldn't make this a weekly spot, but it's a great place to visit once a year or so for a special occasion.</review>

	<review>Came here with the bf to celebrate our 2 year anniversary.  We decided to give this place a try given it's raved reviews on yelp.   Unfortunately, the place was rather crowded and noisy.  My boyfriend and I were basically screaming at each other across the table.  Noise level definitely comparable to old ladies in chinatown.  Our waitress was very nice, but too bad her accent was so heavy we could barely understand anything she said.  My boyfriend and I decided  to each get the regular house of prime rib cut with the sides creamed spinach and baked potato.   The bread came first, and I didn't even bother to try it.  My bf did though, and trust me, don't even bother wasting your time.  It's nothing special.  Next came the salad, which was uber delicious in my opinion (and I'm not even the type to really like vegetables either!)  Then came the baked potato + prime rib + creamed spinach + yorkshire pudding.   I asked for my prime rib medium rare, which it did look sort of medium rare on one side, but practically cooked on the other.  I should've just complained  then and there rather than complain here on yelp.  So that was disappointing.  Regardless, I thought it was chewy, and just mediocre.  The creamed spinach was barfingly gross.  And the yorkshire pudding (i don't even know what the heck it is, but it just looked like some fried egg, which eventually soaked into the creamed spinach and the prime rib sauce and tasted bleh).   To end the night we ordered the home made tiramisu, which was fantastic! It totally melts in your mouth, my bf and I killed it in like a few minutes, fighting to get bites of it before the other finishes it all.   Overall the good: Salad Baked Potato Tiramisu The bad: Ambiance Atmosphere Prime Rib Yorkshire pudding Creamed Spinach Complimentary Bread For a whopping $130 after tips and tax and to like all the cheap parts of the meal, this was a very disappointing experience.  I've had way better prime ribs at family events.  -_-</review>

	<review>Saw this place on the food network.  You definitely get a large amount of meat here.  I think I am only giving it three stars b/c I am not the biggest carnivore-therefore I wouldn't say I am a fan.  But if prime rib is your thing then I would def. rec. this place.</review>

	<review>not a conspiracy theorist but I do believe that this place is racist. I went there with my family twice, dressed nicely, and always polite and got seated in the back room. totally fine. then I took notice of all the people around me and we were all Asian. As I walked thru the great hall to get to the bathroom i notice everyone there was white. Coincidence right? Just paranoid right? Went there a couple months later and the exact same thing happened. the food was good but this place will never get my business again. .</review>

	<review>Every time I visit the city I make reservations in advance to The House of Prime Rib.  It is consistent in quality and flavor.  For about $40, you get a delicious salad hand-tossed at the table in a sherry vinaigrette dressing, creamed spinach or creamed corn, mashed or baked potatoe and a pudding.  All of this along with a perfectly cut Prime Rib cooked the way you want it.   I used to think Lawry's was good, but there's just something about eating Prime Rib in the city at a place like HOPR....mmm.</review>

	<review>The food portions here are huge, but you pay a pretty penny for it too. I got the House of Prime Rib Cut, rare with creamed spinach and baked potato. The meal also comes with a piece of cornbread, salad, and Yorkshire pudding. They give nice crunchy sourdough bread when you sit. Warm and yummy! I did not care for the salad - lettuce with sliced beets, pieces of hard boiled egg and a vinaigrette that tasted like thousand island dressing. The portion is of this like when you order a salad for dinner. Didn't finish it when I know the meat was coming. Creamed spinach - first time I tried it. Didn't like it. My other option was creamed corn and that didn't sound any better. Fresh vegetables would have been nice. There's bits of bacon in it. Baked potato with butter, sour cream, chives, and baked bits. They know how to do baked potatoes here. Cornbread - it looks like a long madeline. It had chunks of corn and bits of jalapeno in it. Good. Yorkshire pudding - first time I ever had this too. Not bad but I though unnecessary. Prime rib - I got lucky and got a slice without a bone. Delish is all I can say. I don't like horseradish so I didn't get any of that. The au jus is good - maybe a bit more salt or something. II ate the whole thing (that was my goal) anyway and each bit was good. They know what they're doing here. I accompanied my meat with a glass of Ravenswood Zinfandel; I thought it was a good pairing. Dessert - we shared a peach melba, bread pudding and strawberry shortcake. Peach melba was ok. Bread pudding tasted like a spice cake to me, okay too but my friends enjoyed it a lot. Strawberry shortcake was light and delicious - moist shortcake with macerated strawberries, whipped cream and strained strawberry sauce. You should definitely order this if you have room for dessert. Did you know you can get an extra slice of meat if you're still hungry? I'm shocked! How anyone can anyone eat another slice is beyond me, but I know there are people out there. The place is pretty packed. The ambiance was more loud than I would have thought a place like this would be. The waitress was nice. The host was vague with answers. They give you some sort of oriental mix while you're waiting for a table.</review>

	<review>Its a nice place with good food. The ambiance is there but the value for money must be looked at. Service is dependent on the night, the lack of water and table service cost 2 stars. I like the drinks, the food, the wait but its not the most awesome place to go to, just good.</review>

	<review>I'm seriously a little concerned that I have not yet written a review for The House of Prime Rib. Ever since we discovered this place many, many, years ago, my family finds any excuse we can to come here. Birthday, graduation, going away party, anniversary,  Mother's Day, Columbus Day... you get the point. I'm not even sure where to begin. The decor is exactly what you would expect for a pricey steak house that's been around for over half a century. Think dark interior, wood and burgundy, and deep booths that allow you to sink in and drink your martini at ease. Oh the martinis, they give you your own shaker with your drink so it's like 2 drinks for 1. I always order the House of Prime Rib cut. Your meal will begin with your own round loaf of bread hot out of the oven, served with fresh whipped butter. Then you get the best salad ever - my dad makes me buy him bottles of this dressing whenever I go home, they're only $3 too!- They mix the salad right at your table. After this and more martinis, the steak cart comes by. They slice off your cut right in front of you and serve it to you with a choice of mashed or baked potato, creamed spinach (although I always get the steamed) and yorkshire pudding, perfect for soaking up all the left-over yumminess on your plate. Also, make sure you ask for the fresh horseradish, if you're into that sort of thing b/c it is spicy and damn good!!! I once almost finished my whole steak here, and if you do, they give you another one free(if you're still hungry). The waiter did offer though and I thought that was pretty cool. I mean, the meals are HUGE. My dad's large ex-football player friend comes here all the time because as my Dad put it, "It's the only place that actually gives him enough food!" And just for the sake of the party, once my sister was trying to steal one of their knives(b/c they are awesome and say House Of Prime Rib on them) and as she was sticking it in her purse a waiter came by and asked her if she wanted it washed first. She said sure and he literally washed the knife and brought it back to her to steal!!! Now that's what I call excellent, accomodating service! So, this place rules. Yes it is pricey, but soooo worth it. Beware though- it may become a new family tradition.</review>

	<review>I like the English cut, medium. It's easier to deal with, and has more consistent "doneness" throughout than the House cut. Tip: the "A La Carte" order seems to be *everything* but the salad and is $7 cheaper, so if you're feeling particularly Chinesey/Jewey today, you can have every other person order the a la carte, and share salads around the table to save a few bucks. Tip: Don't get the creamed corn. It's gross. Seems like they put it on their menu because Lawry's (LA, Vegas) has had it for years, but Lawry's creamed corn is amazing, and HoPR's still has a lot to work on... Even the wait staff will agree. Tip: They do have *real* horseradish in the back, so if you're like me and that whipped stuff just doesn't do it for you, make sure to ask for the real thing! Tip: If you're still hungry after the meal, or just want more bang for your buck (more of the Chinese thing), you can get seconds, thirds, etc... Tip: If you can't decide between the baked or mashed potatoes, order the baked first, and get the mashed with your seconds. Tip: If you don't eat red meat but enjoy fish, their fresh fish offering is pretty solid. I mean, it's not amazing - this IS a prime rib joint after all! Plan to spend a lot of time here. Last night we had a reservation for 9p, they didn't seat us till about 9:30, and we didn't have food in front of us until about 10p. Minus one star there... Otherwise, the food / service / price are all fabulous!</review>

	<review>This was my first visit at House of Prime Rib. I ordered the "A La Carte" which is the House of Prime Rib or English cut but $4 cheaper without the salad. Given the Yorkshire pudding, the generous cut of prime rib, and the creamed corn/spinach, there was more than enough food. Pros: Generous portion of meat. Generous amount of food in general Cooked precisely to specification Frequently refilled water and drinks Fresh-from-the-oven sourdough bread Great service/friendly staff Cons: Despite the reservation, we still had to wait 15 minutes Once we paid, no more water/drink refills I didn't like the creamed spinach or creamed corn - not creamy enough Prime rib itself was pretty good, but not necessarily the best I've ever had. The offer of the additional cut is a bonus and I like the idea that they don't want you to leave unsatisfied. We had a show tickets for right after the meal, so I would have appreciated the timeliness (esp with the reservation) so I'm knocking off a * for that. Otherwise, I would have given the food and service 4 *'s.</review>

	<review>We wanted to celebrate our 35th anniv at a restaurant we knew would serve us well.  We were first disappointed that the valet service opened my door (passenger) then hurried to the driver side and yelled to me to "shut the door"! as if I was expected to do so.  Our reservations at the House of Prime Rib on a MONDAY NIGHT was 1/2 hour LATE seating us (8:30 reservations not seated until 9:00)...the waiter was EXCELLENT; however, we didn't eat until almost 10pm.  We have frequented this establishment for years, and were sorely disappointed...especially on such a special occasion, which was specifically reiterated when confirmation call was made, and we were assured we would be treated well.  Unfortunately, the waiter had no idea we were celebrating such a special occasion.  We were sorely disappointed, and couldn't finish our dinner, due to the lateness of the service.</review>

	<review>Great prime rib! What more can I say!   I wouldn't say the price is too much on the pricey side... I would say it's a good price to pay for good prime rib. I've been to places where it's $20 for a BIG piece of prime rib... but I don't think of it as quantity, I think of it as quality! Elegant, sophisticated and a very warm place to be.  The waiters there are very nice! The salad is one of the best salads I have ever had! If you have dogs at home, you can ask for "doggie bags" where they will give you a bag with the bones so you can bring them home to your dogs!</review>

	<review>I love prime rib.  I'd take it over a New York or any other kind of steak.  This is our go to place for one gorup of friends to celebrate retirements, farewells, promotions, but mainly for the prime rib.   There's a nice selection of wine to go with your meal.  The salad that goes with your meal is okay, but you can't make any changes to it, they toss enough for everyone.  The bread is served nice and warm with butter.  I don't care for the creamed spinach, but all my friends like it.   The best part is the prime rib.  I get the house cut, the rule of thumb is, if you're still hungry after the cut you got, they'll give you a bit more if you ask the waiter.  The serving size is pleanty for me and I usually finsh my order, but I never get to my bake potato (everything on it).  I usually take the for lunch the next day.  And don't forget to get some horseradish sauce, it's the real stuff with a nice kick. They get 5 stars because the food is great and the wait staff is attentative without being annoying.  I just wish we had more reason to go to this place.  The deserts are good too, if you're too full, get one to share.</review>

	<review>I went to the House of Prime Rib for the first time last week with a couple friends.  We have been to the Broadway Prime multiple times and have always wanted to try this more "original" restaurant. We went on a Thursday night and the place was packed and kind of noisy, so definitely not a perfect place for a quiet romantic dinner. There was a short wait but we were there early.  The server was very energetic and friendly.  I ordered the city cut while two of my friends ordered the King Edward cut.  Another friend had their halibut.  Everything was great! I love their salad, which was tossed just right with their tasty dressing on everything but not too much.  Their cuts were just right, very juicy and tender. The King Edward cut was at a better thickness than the ones we got from Broadway Prime. Their yorkshire pudding, creamed corn and creamed spinach were all great although it might not be the best I have had. The only disappointing thing about this restaurant was that it did not have a very good dessert menu.  They had the usual creme brulee, apple crisp, bread pudding, sorbet etc. but nothing very exciting.  We decided to skip dessert after seeing what our neighboring tables got.  Overall, great food, great restaurant and I will definitely go again!</review>

	<review>First off, I would like to say the SALAD is GREAT...yummmm....and they give you a second slice of prime rib if you didn't get enough...the service is excellent. But be sure to make reservations before going there because it is usually pack! Parking is a little hard around there but other than that..this is a great restaurant. And I love how the manager walks to each table and ask the customers how they are doing =)</review>

	<review>i've been coming here since my college days...and it still is just as good now as that love-at-first-bite-bite 5 years ago.  here are my thoughts on each course (which is all included for each meal): crusty sourdough bread:  they always bring it freshly baked right out of the oven.  cut it open, and the steam fogs up your glasses.  inside, the bread is warm and doughy.  outside, perfectly crusty.  smear some butter on...heavenly. house salad:  never thought i would like beets, but in this salad, i do!  not a big fan of salads in general, but i love this one!  they give you a huge plate full, and somehow it always ends up disappearing within a few minutes... baked potato: i never get the mashed potato.  i always encourage everyone to get the baked.  it comes with butter, sour cream, chives, and bacon.  then, it comes with extra butter, sour cream, chives, and bacon.  yes, they really know how to load it on.  have them put in on the side of your plate if you're not sure you want that much.  but, trust me, you do. creamed corn:  this was a great new addition to the menu this year.  they give you a choice of creamed corn or spinach.  the corn is pretty good.  i with there was more corn and a little less cream. yorkshire pudding:  i always pass on this.  not a big yorkie pudding fan - it just takes up valuable space in my stomach. prime rib:  i always get the "english cut" - the thinner cut soaks up more au jus so that there is a higher jus to meat ratio as compared to the thicker house of prime rib cut.  it is melt-in-your-mouth juicy goodness!  i've had me lots of prime rib, and this is top notch. another plus is that if you finish your prime rib, they'll ask if you want another slice!!!  this is a crucial reason why i pass on the yorkshire pudding...</review>

	<review>There's nothing that I love more than a piece of cow and oh my, does HOPR have cow! That meat cart is heaven on wheels! I like the old school feel of the restaurant. The maitre'd is formal without being snotty and the servers are super accomodating. The sourdough bread is tasty; the cornbread is good, but kind of dry. I ordered the smallest cut, well-done (not your typical prime rib, I don't like my cow still mooing on my plate), and it was flavorful and juicy and everything I'd hoped it would be. I had huge expectations for this place and I wasn't disappointed. I'm not a fan of creamed anything, but I totally got down with the creamed spinach. And my baked potato (made to order at the table) was LOADED with bacon. Can you say YUM??? The perfect ending was the creme brulee. I have to try creme brulee at every restaurant I go to and HOPR passed the test. Oh, and the price? SO UNBELIEVABLY REASONABLE. All that for less than $40 in San Francisco. Amazing. Totally becoming a regular.</review>

	<review>For all its legacy, I expected 5 stars.  Ok first, a huge star gets knocked off for the sassy-yet-borderline-rude waiter.  He was trying so hard to have an acerbic wit, yet came off like a total a-hole and kind of insulted one of my friends.  Plus, he didn't really know about Yorkshire pudding.  Said Pink Floyd referenced it, but I told him, NO, general references to pudding in England mean dessert.  When he learned my family is English, my mom makes Yorkshire pudding all the time for fancy meals, and that we were not *completely* ignorant, I think he threw us a bone.  But really, if you're going to work in a "Jolly Old England" joint, you really should know what you are serving before you rant on and on, uninformed. I was very excited to get the prime rib and ordered it medium...it came back to me nearly bloody.  I was really grossed out and two of us asked him if there was any way he could just heat it for a few minutes.  He hesitated and then said it would have to be thrown out....WHY? I don't know.  I mean, can't you just throw it in the microwave, oven or grill for a few minutes???  So, we just dealt with it and ate the outside parts.  VERY disappointed. The good things----great drinks at the bar, some very good side dishes and desserts (awesome horseradish cream, house salad, loaf of bread on cutting board with butter, Yorkshire pudding, "loaded" baked potato), the $7 valet parking by extremely nice, cute boys, and of course, the history and legacy of the place, itself. The bad:  the creamed spinach sucked, meat wasn't done enough (and they refused to cook it for us) and one helluva rude waiter.</review>

	<review>What is there not to love about this place?  maybe the waiting but I am willing to for what I get.  When a place specializes in one thing, they do it well!   You get to choose from multiple cuts of prime rib, from King Henry (HUGE 1 to 1 half inch slice), House cut, English cut (three thin slices). Personal favorite is the house cut with the bone in.  YUM!!  In addition to your exceptional cut of prime rib, you get a salad, killer creamed spinach, Yorkshire pudding and your choice of potato. Go with the Mashed Potatoes - creamy goodness! When they have some time, they will also give you some corn bread as well.  All that for the price of the cut of meat. (unlike some steak places that charge you for everything ala carte! But wait... there's MORE!  You can get seconds, thirds, fourths, etc.  Not that you will be all that hungry after chowing on the food described above but you can get extras.  But, the seconds will be thin slices of prime ribs with your options of all the sides again!  okay... I am drooling now...</review>

	<review>An SF staple.  I don't eat meat, but their fish is good.  Hands down the BEST salad in the entire world.  It's worth it to go just for that.  The staff is extremely attentive and knowledgeable.  Serious comfort food.</review>

	<review>So after a couple attempts, I finally tried HOPR. I thought ahead and made reservations three days in advance, but I still ended up with a 6pm reservation. A little early for me but I figured I would eat a light lunch so I could be hungry by that time. We arrived a little earlier but had to wait for them to open up the other room. There were plenty of people waiting for tables and it was only 6pm on a Wednesday! The decor is kinda nice, but it definitely didnt seem to fit the clientele that night. As I looked around the dimly lit, semi-elegant room with a fireplace in the background, I could see a couple in jeans and sneakers drinking coronas. Its kinda nice that you can go for the expensive prime rib without feeling the need to dress up. As for the food, it was pretty good. Salad was covered in dressing which was good in the beginning, but a bit much in the end. Prime rib was delicious and I really liked the yorkshire pudding. Creamed corn and creamed spinach were okay, but nothing too special. Cremebrulee for dessert was delicious! Overall, food was pretty good, but the hassle of getting reservations and the wait will probably put me off from going back anytime soon.</review>

	<review>I started coming here almost 10 years ago, and although the price has gone up since then, the quality and taste still remains the same.  This place still sets the standard for a good piece of prime rib.... I've sampled several other restaurants which offered even pricier cuts, but still can't match the quality. Their bread is always fresh and hot when arriving at your table, salad is good, and the sides are excellent as always.  They've added creamed corn a few years ago for those who don't like spinach.   One gripe about House of Prime Rib is how the dress code has started to go downhill.  When you walk into a restaurant expecting to pay $30+ per plate, you assume to dress the part.  I can't stand the ones who wander in there in shorts, or jerseys.  Granted House of Prime Rib doesn't have that romantic (date) vibe to it, but it's still a place for occasions, and when you when you see people dressed like they just came from the park, it is a bit of a let-down.</review>

	<review>wow, 1,000 some reviews huh. i've actually been here quite a few times, and i've been meaning to review it for the longest time. there are a couple things i like about this place. one, its really consistent. you come here, you know and expect exactly what you're getting, since the menu, according to the server i talked to one of the times, hasn't changed since 1950 or something. number two, this place is also consistently good. the steak is always good, the cream of corn and spinach is always good, the yorkshire pudding is awesome, my favorite. number three, the reason why i gave it give stars, is because for what you pay, you get a TON of consistent, good food. definitely one of my favorite places in SF.</review>

	<review>consistantly great prime rib. i've been to HOPR over 25 times now and i have never been disappointed. you will never leave this place hungry. choose your cut of prime rib and sides and they take care of the rest. they have the best salad tossed table side. they even sell the salad dressing and house seasoning now. the bread is always served piping hot. always ask them for cornbread and they will come out with a basket of warm cornbread spears that will leave you asking for more. when the prime rib comes out, it is always cooked perfectly. i always order english cut, RARE...oh so good. i always go with the baked potato with EVERYTHING on it. a generous serving of creamed spinach is also served on the same plate. then the waiter will come by with a pan of yorkshire pudding that you can use to soak up all the delectable au jus from the meat. you will be pretty full after all that, but you can order seconds, thirds, and beyond until you are fully satisfied. and if there is still room, i recommend the peach melba for dessert. it's a classic. and don't forget to grab some mints on your way out!</review>

	<review>come on people. so what if it's a San Francisco institution. this place is tired, old and needs to be put out to pasture. good beef? big deal - can be had a all sorts of other places in the city that have what HOPR doesn't: ambiance, good service, tasty sides/ala cart items. want a killer dinner? go to Bar Tartine instead. want to pay too much for mediocre food, crappy service and dusty fake books? HOPR is for you. No thanks.</review>

	<review>This place has a lot of reviews so I'll just write a quick and short one.  It was a while back since I've been..but comparing this place to Lawry's in Beverly Hills is no contest.  Hence, the 4-star.  Great place..but doesn't have anything on Laaaaaawry's! Anyhow, the meat was cut well, potatoes were awesome as well as the sides.  Definitely not the best I've had.  Ambiance was fantastic and couldn't expect for better service.</review>

	<review>This is my kind of restaurant: expensive at first glance, but when you leave you feel like your money was well spent. The portions were gigantic, but more importantly, everything tasted awesome. I went here with my wife to celebrate an occasion on a Tuesday night. Earlier in the day my wife had called to make reservations but they apologized saying they were fully booked, though we might be able to slide in if we showed up early, around 6PM. We figured we'd give it a shot and ended up walking into a pretty empty restaurant. So, if you can't manage reservations, try to show up early, especially on a slow week night. By the time we left, it was packed. After being seated we were handed the brief menus and made our prime rib cut selection, the English Cut for my wife and the Henry VIII for myself. For sides we both wanted the same thing,  mashed potatoes, creamed spinach. We were immediately brought bread, butter, and our drinks. The bread was piping hot out of the oven. The cold butter easily melted on the bread and tasted delicious. Next out was the salad, the dressing they use is fantastic, we tried to curb ourselves here a little bit in preparation for our battle with upcoming our prime rib plates. It was difficult but we distracted ourselves long enough for our main plate to come out. As they placed the plates in front of us we paused for a second, salivating and admiring.  My wife was disappointed in her English Cut, thinking she was going to have no trouble finishing it, and regretting not having instead gotten the largest cut. This turned out to just be a case of her eyes being larger than her stomach. We both enjoyed every portion served. The mashed potatoes were good, so was the creamed spinach, and the prime rib. None of the items struck my wife or I as amazing, but together they became a very strong team. We were absolutely stuffed and though I finished my initial cut, there was no possible way that I could even fathom a bite of the offered complementary slice. My wif had a remaining uneaten slice of her English cut, defeated. Desert was not in the cards. Our waitress was very attentive, courteous, and helpful. We gave her a deserved tip and left. We both felt like this is a place we would come back to, perhaps with friends and relatives, but not on a regular basis otherwise. In any other town this could be a regular great place, but there is just too much in this town to devote too many sittings to any great restaurant.</review>

	<review>The Hindenburg may have been a disaster, but the Hindenburg resembling rolling cart containing the best roasted beef this side of the Mississippi is not. WOW! Why have I never been here before? A San Francisco institution indeed and oh so good on all fronts. You walk through the doors and you are literally transported back into the 40s. The color red, the wood, the dark lighting, the smell of juicy prime rib, I was in heaven. We were celebrating my boyfriend's birthday and his number one choice was the HOPR. The place is so busy, we could only get 4:30 reservations. I thought, oh great, it's going to be us and the early bird seniors. Boy was I wrong. The place was packed with diners of all ages and backgrounds. We were seated in the room that resembled a library. Without even a moment's wait, we had fresh ice water and piping hot sourdough bread and butter on our table. The wine list is bloody fantastic! I also couldn't believe how good the pricing was, considering we were in a popular restaurant in the City. They had a good representation of wines from the mid-$30s all the way up. I followed my boyfriend's lead and ordered the House cut (yeah, I can put it away). This comes with a hand tossed or shall I say, spun on ice and then tossed salad. Okay, I can be really "When Harry Met Sally" with my salad. I like dressing on the side and I certainly don't like eggs in my salad - but I decided to go with it and damn that was one of the best tasting salads ever. All the flavors intertwined together seamlessly. I went with the mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. Were these the best sides I've ever had? No, but they did the job. The creamed spinach had tiny bits of bacon (you KNOW I was happy). Let's face it, the headliner is the prime rib. There it was, on my plate, in all its juicy glory, a big cut of tender goodness. The au jus was complemented by Yorkshire pudding. It's genius and our server was right, it does soak up the au jus nicely. Oh and the horseradish. You get three kinds delivered to your table from mild to spicy and of course I jumped right to the spicy one. I was never a fan of horseradish much before, but it seriously is the perfect condiment for prime rib. They partner beautifully. So, as any good foodie would do, I inhaled the whole thing. And thanks to my boyfriend's prodding, I had seconds. He insisted the second slice was dessert and I'm not the kind of girl who says no to dessert. The deal is that if you finish your first cut, you will get a complimentary slice. These slices of course are cut thinner, but trust me if you can even get to seconds you have a tank for a stomach. However, you have to eat it there, you can not doggy bag it. I got through about half of it. Let me tell you, that is a A LOT of meat to eat. My boyfriend was impressed. :o) We were running late to our next stop, so we skipped the dessert cart, besides my boyfriend's red velvet birthday cheesecake was in the car (as if I will ever really skip dessert). Our server insisted on getting our photo before we left. I think it's so great they give you this memento. My boyfriend had THE most satisfied look on his face in this photo. I think it is very representative of the HOPR experience. Great service, awesome food, terrific wine, and the desire to come back for more. Bravo!</review>

	<review>4 different types of cuts for the prime rib, they range from $37 to $42. The meal includes salad, cornbread, yorkshire pudding, spinach, corn, and potatoes. You also get three types of horseradish with your meat. Aside from the meat, the salad is my favorite part of the meal. Remember to ask for complimentary seconds!</review>

	<review>The cocktails are good and generous. You get a second drink in the shaker along with your manhattan or martini. A perfect way to spend the time as you wait for your table! The menu is pretty straightforward. Which cut of beef do you want? There is a fish option, but that's probably a special case... You also get the option of creamed corn instead of the creamed spinach, and baked versus mashed potato. Otherwise, your biggest choice is your wine - they have a fairly extensive wine list. The bread comes out warm and delicious. You will be tempted to wolf it down, but do yourself a favor, and just eat a little, to tide you over, because next comes... The salad is very well composed. Bite sizes pieces of vegetables in a smooth and tasty dressing, spun at your table. Again, pace yourself here, there is more food to come,and there are definitely nights where this salad and the bread could have composed my entire dinner. Next up, the main course. Slice off the cart comes your prime rib, along with your potato and creamed spinach. The sides are fantastic. Literally fantastic. Soon will come out your yorkshire pudding - this will take up the rest of the space you saved from not eating bread earlier. You will also get your choice of horseradish. I chose the raw, because I am used to it, and the milder sauces just didn't seem worth it to me. Your taste will vary, but I recommend at least giving the raw grated horseradish a shot - especially if your nose is stuffed up! I'll be honest and say I found the prime rib tasty, but I am not as impressed with it as I was by everything else. If you have good beef, you just need to make sure to not cook it too much, and you will have good food. Properly preparing side dishes shows more skill, to me. But I'm a bit crazy like that. And now we come to dessert. You might be too full for dessert, and that's fair. But if not, there are some tasty things on the menu to fill up the specially reserved dessert stomach we all have.</review>

	<review>Was in town for a conference, had to come here. It's still amazing. Brilliant service, big comfy red booths, your dinner rolls comes stabbed to the wooden serving plate. My king size steak was amazing and huge - perfectly medium rare. I'd be hard pressed to come here more than once or twice a year due to the gluttony of the experience, but every time I do, it's amazing.</review>

	<review>Despite finding out that I'm terribly allergic to Tokyo Iced Teas the last time I dined at House of Prime Rib with my girlfriends, I still continue to be impressed with their quality of food and service.  I would go there just to eat the side dishes!  I usually get the mashed potatoes, but getting the loaded baked potato is just as good.  And their cream spinach...mmm, the best I've ever had.  Make sure you don't fill yourself up on their salad though...I know it's hard not to, but you have to save room for the best part of the meal - the rib!  The rib itself is cooked to perfection, just how you like it.  And what's better, is that you can keep the bone for your kanine.  I don't have a dog, but I give it to friends who do. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time because most likely, you will still have to wait a bit because that place is ALWAYS packed.</review>

	<review>First time here though I heard great things about it and it's all true.  All they serve is Prime Rib.  You get a complete meal for under $40 per person (at the time of this writing) minus drinks and dessert.  Your Prime Rib comes with fresh baked sourdough bread, generous size house salad, baked or mashed potatoes, creamed spinach or creamed corn, and Yorkshire pudding.  The Prime Rib is carved right at your table.  I got the house cut which were a good size and about an inch thick.  It was very tender and cooked to perfection.  I couldn't finish it and ended up bringing the rest home.  The king cut, which is $2 more, was a bargain if you have a large appetite or want to bring the rest home for leftovers.  We had an excellent waiter and the rest of the staff very friendly.  The only problem I had was getting reservations at a decent time.  I can see why.</review>

	<review>Finally was able to make a trip to the famous House of Prime Rib. I grew up in San Francisco, and am well familiar with the place. Even as a kid, I remember going by the restaurant and wondered just what was going on in there. Fast forward to the present--it is my wedding anniversary, and the spouse and I decided to take the leap and go to HOPR. We ordered the only thing that was available on the menu--prime rib, what else? You order the size of the cut, and everything else comes with the dinner such as the creamed spinich, salad, potato, and fixings. (A warning to budget minded--this place isn't Sizzlers, so be prepared to pay at least $40 per person on your visit there. Yes, it's expensive, but for special occasions, or to fill your carnovore cravings, it is the place to go.) The prime rib was outstanding--juicy, tender and flavorful. Our waiter was efficient, friendly and professional. Parking can be done with the vallet service for $7, but a quick look around the area should offer some metered parking. Just be prepared to feed the meter after an hour. Watch out for the meter maid patrol as they mark your tires to make sure you don't stay in the same spot for over 60 minutes. Just make reservations after 6pm, and your worries are over--the meters go out of commission after 6. Speaking of reservations, it will be close to impossible to just walk in for a table, which takes me to my next point... When you make reservations over the phone, there is a hostess there by the name of PAM. I capitalize her name in order to make sure that she gets due credit for being one of the most snobish and totally arrogant people that I have had the misfortune in talking with. Although all she does is answer the phone and direct traffic at the restaurant, she seems to think she is related to royalty and thus, treats customers with contempt. What in the world was House of Prime Rib thinking when they hired this creatin? She is condescending and extremely rude. We made our reservations with another individual, and all was well. If not for this snide person, PAM, House of Prime Rib would have received a higher rating from us. Management--fire her, she's making your establishment look horrible.</review>

	<review>I haven't been to this place for like 3 or 4 years until recently.  I now remember why....it isn't all that!  The only thing changed was the prices....from a House Cut at $23 to $33!  King cut from $27 to $36. I never did like their salad...taste and look like high school cafeteria salad.  The creme of spinach was nothing to scream about nor was the mash potatoes.  The service hasn't changed a bit....fake!  They're trying to hard to earn your tips.   $33 bucks for a piece of bloody meat.  You could get the same at Lyon's for $17bucks.</review>

	<review>Yummy and Fun! In preparation for my what I knew would be an epic meal, I ate only a tangelo and some baby carrots.   My plan worked and I was able to consume (almost) everything set before me.   We were the group you didn't want to sit next to if you came for an intimate anniversary dinner.  Thankfully for the other patrons, we were seated in a room with a few other large parties so we could laugh as loudly as we wanted!  We had quite a wait to be seated, despite having a reservation, but we were chattering and didn't really notice.   The atmosphere is great - very old San Francisco.  I squealed when I first saw the Zepplin of meat that housed my impending dinner.  Note:  yelp says the place is "dressy" but it isn't.  I wouldn't wear a t-shirt but if you wear a cocktail dress and get your hair did, you might feel a bit out of place. You can read the myriad other reviews to find out how this place works.  I believe our party of six ordered all the different cuts: city, English and one of us ordered the King Henry which looked like something you'd get at a Renaissance Fair(e).  Impressive.  I ordered the English cut which is thinner and supposedly a bit more flavorful.  I took my first bite and was pleasantly surprised at how yummy, tender and juicy it was.  It was great!  The mashed potatoes are delicious (a bit of garlic?) as is the YORKSHIRE PUDDING which I don't see on menus much.  Everyone seemed pleased with their meals.  As a table, we shared the creme brulee and bread pudding which were very tasty.  We had two birthdays so the desserts came out with candles and we got  a photo of the table in a goofy little paper frame.  Awesome.   It's a bit on the pricey side but you get a metric ton of food and lots of fun kitsch for your money so how can you complain?</review>

	<review>I think the quality of the food at house of prime rib has gone down, but it still is the best deal in the city. I guarantee at the end of your meal, you'll be STUFFED. But if you still don't have the urge to unbutton your pants at the table, you can always get a second slice on the house! I love the salad, and have begged for the dressing recipe several times, to no avail. The prime rib is always juicy, and I love the fresh horseradish. It gets really crowded, so try to make reservations. I've got them saved on my cell!</review>

	<review>I'll change this review once they actually ACCEPT my reservation. I had to call four times to not get a busy signal. When I finally got through, I was immediately put on hold and five minutes later they hung up on me! I call them back and ask them for a reservation for two; they ask me what time I say 8. Then they proceed to mumble something about being booked for the entire night and I tell them that I couldn't quite hear them. Silence for about 5 seconds. Then he tells me to "try another night!" How rude can you get? Edit: I actually got a reservation this time. The food is not bad but there is much better. Try Harris'.</review>

	<review>Made reservations for a Saturday night at 7pm, arrived at 6:40pm with a complete party, and still didn't get seated until 7:20pm.  The atmosphere overall was extremely loud, but I guess that has to be expected from a crowded restaurant.   The waitress was extremely nice, greeted us right away and took our drink orders.  In a party of 5 ppl, 2 girls got the thinner cuts and 3 other ppl got the House of Prime Rib cut.  I totally agree that the prime rib here has to be the best I've ever had.  The meat was cut perfectly and both cuts were extremely juicy and tender.   The reason for the two stars is really because of all the sides that came with it and the overall restaurant atmosphere.  The salad was mixed at the table (great concept) but it had too much dressing for my taste.  The creamed corn and mashed potatoes were decent but not spectacular.  And the yorkshire pudding was REALLY bad when  you compare it to the yorkshire pudding at Broadway Prime.   Actually I think all the sides at Broadway Prime were much better, but the prime rib can't compare--it's the best at HOPR.   I might go again if there was a celebration dinner there, but it wouldn't be my first choice.</review>

	<review>so i'll make it short... our waitress was the BEST. went here recently for a birthday (not mine) and had the BEST service... i think her name was tammy. we sat in the beefeater room, it was nice a cozy... we were in the corner, so it was definitely quiet &amp; nice to be all warm next to the fireplace. the food was not the BEST prime rib i've had, but maybe b/c i had stuffed myself with all that bread.... i wish they had asked how much dressing i wanted, but when she was pouring that dressing in, i thought it was an endless flow of dressing... made the salad all salty. all in all, it was nice to be there after all these years, but next time.. i think i'll try harris' or ruth's down the street....</review>

	<review>Holy Americana.  Wear your elastic buffet pants and get ready to stuff yourself at HOPR.  The "H" stands for heartburn because you will leave with one after eating here!  Only in this country does this excessiveness exist and it is normal.  The food is good and priced decently.  Everything they serve is very rich.  I still can't get over how much they serve you (I'm shaking my head AGAIN as I think about it).  Do try it out as it is an experience!  I tried it once and that is all I need.</review>

	<review>Went there with some co-workers on Friday night and had a great experience. Love the martinis which come with a separate shaker. I tend to nurse my martinis b/c I'm a lightweight and the shaker kept my martini nice and cold. Plus, there's a lot, so you get about two drinks in one order. Prime rib was excellent. No need to state the obvious. A lot of people have mentioned you get more if you finish what you ordered. That only applies to the bigger cuts. If you get the smallest cut, you won't be offered more meat. I couldn't handle anymore anyway. Never had creamed spinach or Yorkshire pudding until that night. Both were good. My mashed potatoes had lumps in it -- yummy.  Everything else -- salad, sourdough, cornbread -- was excellent. For dessert, got the bread pudding which was warm and gooey and yummy. Loved it. Our server, Steve, was really friendly and funny and made our experience really great. Pretty pricey -- It came out to $85/person for my party. Would definitely go back for a special occasion.</review>

	<review>I feel so bad giving this place so few stars, but I can't do the whole steak thing if it's not wagyu (GOD, WHAT A HIGH-MAINTENANCE CUNT). The building is kind of nice, but it's definitely far too crowded to be in my favor. To be completely honest, it kind of feels like the Applebee's of fancy steakhouses.</review>

	<review>I am so disappointed... Ive been wanting to go to HoPR for quite some time and I finally made it last night... For any other restaurant my review would have been a solid 3 *'s...but heres my logic for the 2 * rating: This is the House of Prime Rib...not the house of salad, or baked potato...or even the House of Steak.  You would figure that the meat they base their name on would be better than mediocre - it would be Phenomenal!  Unfortunately, its not the case. Dont get me wrong...the experience is pretty fun (if you know you want a Prime Rib) - the staff is great, the atmosphere is very old school but definitely a steak house...and the wine list is solid.  But the Prime Rib was middle of the road - at best. I ordered the King Henry cut - medium rare...it was HUGE and cooked well...but it was more fatty than usual and lacking flavor.  The salad was excellent and the baked potato was great...but the creamed spinach and Yorkshire Pudding were nothing to rave about...in fact, the spinach was pretty disgusting. Bottom line - if youve wanted to try this place - go, but only once.  If youre on the fence - stay home.  If youve only got $40 to your name and may not eat again for a month...youll get your fill here.   For my money, Id rather get a Prime Rib at Izzys or Harris'...or head to Brazenhead and get a great fillet.</review>

	<review>It was our second time to HOPR when we took our out of town friends there for dinner on Saturday.  We were able to book a reservation for 4 for 9:30pm at 7pm using Open Table.  One thing to keep in mind is that they usually make you wait 10-30 minutes for your table (confirmed with other friends) so be patient - it's worth the wait.  As someone else said, no need to get the biggest size since the sides are plentiful.  I got the House cut and it's plenty big.  The bread, salad, yorkshire pudding, creamed corn or spinach, and mashed or baked potato are all very good and very filling.  Since the potato and the meat are easy to reheat the next day, I eat the other stuff like it's going out of style and only eat a little of the meat and potatoes.  I always leave stuffed to the gills and having to pop an antacid pill later, but it's worth it!  I think the prices are reasonable considering the amount of food and the quality.  Others may disagree, but the 4 of us loved it!</review>

	<review>I'm not a fan of prime rib.. I guess I like my filet mignon or any other cut better than prime rib. Who knows why! We came here on Friday and it was pretty packed. Had to wait for a 7:30 spot.. got in there around 7:15 for some wine pre-dinner and got seated right away. The booths are so cramped! We sat at the booth for four people but it was small even for us! I felt really warm in the place too.. Anyway, our waiter was funny and nice.. Forgot his name.. but we all agreed he looked like he could play the villain in the movies.. He had the accent.. had the sorta stern look on his face.. just missing the guns which he'd pull from under his apron. ANYWHO.. We had several glasses of wine from the bar and at our table.. ordered the largest cut, two city cuts, and an english cut. I got the city cut with mashed potatoes and creamed corn. . way better than the creamed spinach. And the yorkshire pudding? What the heck is that? If I'm considering everything I got and the only unsure thing of them all.. it would have to be the yorkshire pudding. It was a flat crispy bready type thing right? NOT good .. and did NOT go well with the meal. I just don't get why they had to tease me like that. I was expecting something sweet! Lastly, we had dessert.. strawberry shortcake and creme brulee. The creme brulee is good but the strawberry shortcake's bread/cakey part was too dry. Was not the best I've tried. Overall a good experience with HOPR, but I do not care for prime rib much nor were any of their accompaniments mind-blowing... so I would not go out of my way to eat here again. Unless I was stopping in for some wine :)</review>

	<review>AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS! Our favorite restaurants during our trip to SF! The service was amazing - attentive and informative! SALAD  was YUM! Love the beets in it! How could anyone not be impressed by that cart rolling out to your table carrying the different cuts of prime rib! The city-cut was perfect for me but all you guys out there must get the king henry! If you can finish it, they will bring you another piece as big as my city-cut piece plus all the sides again! The prime rib was tender, juicy, perfect! Gravy was to die! Love how they give you 3 different types of horse radish - can't decide which one I like more. Both cream spinach and corn were good. My bf can't decide between the two so the waiter was nice enough to let him have both! Well - worth the price! For the three of us - it came to around $150 roughly. It is pricy but I would trade this for any gourmet dinner any day.</review>

	<review>Oh House of Prime Rib, how you utterly underwhelmed me. My girlfriends and I try to get together for a nice dinner about once every 3 months, so for our December get together, this was where we decided to go. After all the rave reviews I've heard, I was pretty excited. But after having now gone myself, I do not understand why people love this place. The prime rib itself is decent, but because this is the "House of Prime Rib", I kind of expected better. The au jus was way too salty and the side dishes weren't anything spectacular. With the exception of the creamed spinach, which was definitely the highlight of my dinner. The service was also pretty unimpressive. The waitress we had was nice enough at first, but by the end of the meal it was pretty much impossible to get her, or any other server's, attention. Really, there's 5 servers standing around and you're all so engrossed in what you're doing that you can't even say "oh I'll be right with you". Unimpressed. For the price I really expected more. I was thoroughly unimpressed and underwhelmed. The only reason they get 2 stars is because the restaurant was nicely decorated for Christmas, the meat was decent enough, and I really enjoyed the creamed spinach.</review>

	<review>Truly disappointed. My husband &amp; I used to go there so often (pre-kid) we both had their phone number on speed dial.  "HOPR"  used to be a favorite haunt of ours for a good 10+ years, so we know what they used to be like. After tonight, we are never, ever, ever going again: 1) 45 min wait w/ a reservation 2) giving me attitude b/c they wrote down "2 adults" instead of "2 adults + 1 toddler" 3) 45 min wait for food after seating = unacceptable ESPECIALLY since there's a whole cow being wheeled around &amp; the only variance in menu choice is the cut 4) screwing up my order:  medium does not = medium rare. 5) forgetting our drinks 6) limp salad 7) overpriced:  $100 for 2 entrees, a cocktail, &amp; a Coke.  Food was lukewarm at best.   8) waiting over 15 min to get our car from the valet guys (b/c there were only 2 working).  Worse yet, they were so short-handed they were parking cars in 2 out of the 3 lanes on Van Ness.  Can we all yell "accident waiting to happen???" The service used to be so attentive &amp; accomodating...  what the hell happened?</review>

	<review>There are almost 2,000 reviews of this place, so what can I add to the dialouge. Well, to some of you Yelpers, this is NOT a SteakHouse. It is the HOPR. That is Prime Rib, roasted. Not a steak broiled or grillled. You may want to call it a meat house and you would get it right. Well, they get it right on what they do and that is very lmited. It is hard to do the research on whehter they copied the formula from Lawry's or the other way aound. See Shakespeare and Bacon. For those of you from LA, Vegas or Chicago, this place does it the same way as Lawry's. That is a good thing. From the salad, to the sides, to the sliced cuts and extra portions. On the negative side for this place. Soooo hard to get a reservation. Know why? So few places to get a good cut a meat in the City, so this place draws them in. And, yes. You can get a good cut of meat here. Very good meat but far from a really great place.</review>

	<review>Often imitated, never replicated. Having gone to Broadway Prime the week before, I was ready to compare the two. I've been to both on numerous occasions, but I've been frequenting Broadway more often due to the fact that they can accommodate large reservations. However, for a party of 4, we got a table, Saturday night, 7:00pm. However, before going I was informed that a 5th party, a child mind you, was going to be joining us. We showed up promptly at 7:00 and when I informed the hostess about the addition of a mere child, we were told we would have to wait longer for a more 'suitable' table. Turns out we weren't seated until 7:45. Nonetheless, service was awesome, I believe our server was named Dennis who did a wonderful job attending to our table. First up, the bread. The bread was fresh baked, out of the oven, sourdough. Crisp, crunchy skin with a nice tangy texture, all warm and toasty. Superb. They brought back the cornbread!!! Cornbread was always one the highlights of my meal here, and for a while, they took it away. I was so glad to see they brought it back. Then came the salad. Unlike Broadway Prime where the salad is premade in the kitchen in a huge vat probably, brought to your table in uneven portions with the veggies drowned in the dressing (which is quite bland I might add) all wilted and dry, they bring you a fresh bowl and show you the ingredients, describe them, and then mix the greens with the dressing in front of you. Fresh, tasty, perfect. No one can ever replicate this dressing. It is the House original. Now comes the main attraction. The meat. I ordered the King Henry cut no less, medium rare, and it came out perfect. A huge medium rare slab of meat right on the bone. It was nearly fork tender, no tendons or ligaments, juicy and flavorful. The au jus was perfect in savoriness. As for the sides, the mashed potatoes, perfectly fluffy with the tasty gravy. And last but not least, my favorite, the creamed spinach. Last time at Broadway Prime, I had cream of spinach practically. There were chunks of coagulated cream, almost in the form of cheese is how I would describe it. The ratio not right. But here at HOPR, perfectly blended. Just enough cream to make it mouth watering creamy, some bacon bits dropped into it, iron potent spinach, and just the right hit of nutmeg. When asked if I wanted to second helping of meat, I kindly replied no and asked for a second helping of spinach. Yeah, it's that good. I turned down meat for veggies. Only here people. Only here.</review>

	<review>YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM..... What else can I say? The best prime rib ever! Not only is the prime rib fantastic. Everything here is delicious from the salad before your entree to the sides of spinach and mashed potatoes served with your prime rib. THE BEST!!! We go here once or twice a year for special occasions and I am never disappointed. Everything is delicious!!!</review>

	<review>For my first experience, I came here with my boyfriend and our 18 month old daughter. I guess you can say I had much higher expectations from watching it on Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations. This place is definitely not an "Alexanders" type steak house (like that in Cupertino). Rather its more traditional, and seems more like homestyle meals. My rating is based on food quality, service and setting (including seating). Let me start of with the setting....this is the DOWNFALL for me and my bf. We made reservations about two weeks in advance, and they placed us at a table where each of our backs were against the wall and we were sitting side by side of each other (imagine that). My boyfriend to the left, my daughter to the right, and our table wasn't even a foot away from another two tables. Felt like either we were watching everyone eat...or everyone watched us eat. Felt like we were invading everyone else's privacy. NOT COOOOOL!!! I was hoping for a more private and semi romantic setting because my boyfriend and I do not often get the chance to eat out as much as we'd like especially since we've had our daughter. So TWO THUMBS DOWN on this one!!!!!! Seriously...killed the mood for me. Okay...now for the positives...lets get down with the food. I ordered the King Henry Cut (medium well) and my boyfriend also ordered King Henry Cut (medium) and we ordered the kids meal prime rib (well done of course) for my daughter. The sides included: Sourdough bread (appetizer), Beet salad (which was mixed in front of us), creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, baked potato (fully loaded), and creamed corn. Our desserts included: fruit with whip cream and creme brulee. Our prime ribs were definitely good, melt in your mouth good, but my prime rib was definitely more on the cooked side and therefore tougher, it seemed to be more well done than medium well :( I tried my boyfriends and it was great! I also tried my daughters and for it being well done, it was good, but I do suggest if you are to get something medium well or well done, get a thinner cut steak. The meat by the bone was definitely grand, and I loved the variety of offered horseradish condiments. The other complaint that my boyfriend and I did have was the temperature of the prime rib. I do not know how they normally serve their prime ribs but ours were room temperature and not at all warm. (They were really busy that day, and maybe it compromised our meal serving time?!? IDK). The sides were pretty good. I especially liked the baked potato because I had an option of what to put and obviously I fully loaded mine up, this was steaming hot by the way. The mashed potato was mediocre, and the creamed spinach was alright, but complimented the prime rib. Sourdough bread and Beet salad were realllllly good!! I looove sourdough bread!!!! Creamed corn was probably one of mine and my daughter's favorite sides. The deserts...how can I complain...they're deserts!!! I love eating strawberries with my creme brulee, and that's the reason why we ordered the fruit with whipcream (but honestly each dessert was $8 and a wine glass full of strawberries with whipcream doesn't compare to the cost of a good portion sized creme brulee). The service was good. She did have a heavy accent and we had to ask her to repeat things often, but she was very friendly and always smiling. They servers were very tentative in quickly replacing dropped utensils (dropped utensils is expected for a toddler). It's definitely not going to be our last time here though, gotta give it another try, and possibly request better seating.</review>

	<review>I have been going to the House of Prime Rib since I was very young and it has always been one of my favorite places to dine and often go there for special occassions. This is not a place to go if you are looking for variety, but it does an excellent job of delivering the traditional English Dinner. The experience is very consistent from the excellent service to quality and tasty prime rib. I am picky about the quality of meat I eat when I dine out and seldom eat meat out as I can typically prepare a better steak or roast at home. House of Prime Rib always delivers a juicy extra rare piece to me which is the only way I will eat prime rib. They will also offer a complimentary second cut if you so desire. The baked potatoes are loaded with extra goodness. I thoroughly enjoy their unique salad as well, but the creamed spinach and yorkshire pudding however tasty are not superb. Regardless it is the entire experience and meal that make House of Prime Rib a staple for me and my family.</review>

	<review>my husband and i live in san jose... a good 45 minute drive. it's worth it. he always orders the king henry and i order a step down from that. their salad is yummy. seems very simple, but delicious. sides are great. we always get creamed spinach, creamed corn, and baked potatoes (which are HUGE!) we finish off our dinner w/creme brulee. the whole experience is YUM. Also, they should offer you seconds (it's a small slice, but it's still yummy meat!) if you've completed your first piece of meat. if they don't offer you it.. your server's probably selfish and trying to get you out faster. the only problem with this place is the waiting time. it's a very popular restuarant obviously, so it comes with the territory. even if you set a reservation, come a little early.. you end up waiting. sometimes you can wait up to almost over an hour, WITH a reservation. BUT NOW... we figured it out. we decide to have an earlier dinner.. we come in around when cocktail hour opens (5pm and dinner starts @ 6pm) and just walk-in with no reservation. We always get seated right away, because we beat the crowd. Not so bad.. having dinner around 6ish.</review>

	<review>Last night was my first time here and my BF has been dining here for years (SF native).  The food was good, but the crazy floor show was not needed.  I was very close to the 60+ man who kept dropping the F bomb. Another patron 30+ asked him to watch the language and that is when 60+ charged the fellow at the table enjoying a family birthday celebration.  This was not a "suit" problem as stated by Jessica M another reviewer.  This was the most ridiculous dining experience ever - thanks to another fight that occurred at another 6 person table in the same room.  Very unfortunate event.  All said, the prime rib was the BEST.</review>

	<review>924th review of HOPR.  I've been wanting to try this place forever since everyone knows about this place and it's been reviewed on Check Please and Chowhounds.  I thought it was ok for what it is. Made reservations on OpenTable which was easy, made it maybe a month before my date.   Parking is hard to find, luckily someone was pulling out on Polk and we got her spot.  You can do Valet for $8, or I saw a parking garage for $6 at a nearby side street. On the day I made it for 8pm, but we managed to get to the restaurant by 7pm.  We checked in and let them know we were early.   Hubby got a Green Apple Martini $8.5-vodka &amp; Bols Sour apple liqueur shaken &amp; garnished w/ a maraschino cherry.  He didn't care for it, but he didn't want to complain.  I would have. There are bar nuts/crackers in a small glass so you can drink &amp; eat before your meal. After 20 min, we were taken to our table.  We got seated in a middle area where there was only 3 other tables around.  It probably was the quietest area which I mentioned in my reservation. Hot sourdough bread w/ a knife in the center &amp; butter on the side soon brought out.  We ate the whole loaf right away.  Then a huge bowl of salad is brought and the waitress spins it and adds dressing &amp; mixes it all up.  There's Roman lettuce, iceberg lettuce, beets, egg, and something else.  It was ok..kinda boring to eat after awhile. Then the guy comes over to carve your prime rib.  I picked English cut $36.85 which are thinner slice of medium amount of meat.  I ordered it Medium rare and it was.  Comes w/ cream spinach or cream corn.  I got the cream spinach - it was ok, not my favorite. Hubby got the Prime Rib cut $36.85 - bigger cut of same amount of meat - medium amount.  He enjoyed it.  He got a side of cream corn - tasted like corn not from a can, but not very good either. We both got to share the Yorkshire pudding - which comes in a frying pan that looks like a puffed up pancake.  Kinda boring to eat, no taste. Baked potato or mashed w/ your meal.  We both got baked potato (heard mashed is better) and she asked if you want everything: sour cream, butter, bacon.  We did.  It was ok. Since I marked it as an Anniversary meal we got a scoop of chocolate ice cream w/ 2 candles + a Polaroid picture of the two of us in a HOPR paper frame.  That was cute.  The couple next to us was celebrating a birthday &amp; got the same thing so I kinda expected it for us.  It was Nice! Only bad part was on the bill his drink was $10 and marked Grey Goose, when it should have been Green Apple Martini $8.5.  That was not noticed until I got home.   They have fresh fish it said on the menu, No chicken, but most everyone goes &amp; gets the prime rib. Bill: $36.85 + $36.85 + $10 = $83.70 + 7.11 tax = $90.81 Before tip. Oh well, Average food, but if you want to Celebrate a Birthday or Anniversary maybe it's worth checking out. FREE matchbox in the front by host &amp; huge amounts of mints: regular &amp; chocolate available near the front too. Tip: Get the City Cut $34.45, then ask for SECONDS (per chowhounds).  The cheap bastard way to eat there ~ save $2.40.</review>

	<review>Just went there for yet another birthday dinner - a year and a half later - and if I never go back, it would be okay with me. The food before was just "okay"  but this time we were just fully disappointed. It's too bad, too. There aren't a lot of San Francisco institutions left, and, while not great, HPR was at least CONSISTENT. You always knew what to expect. This last time it just fully sucked. Bummer.</review>

	<review>If you are not a red meat eater, than this is not the place. If you are a vegitarian. This is not the place. If you are a light eater. This is not the place. They do not serve soup.  I went recently and was not able to eat a thing from the 2 page menu. If you have small kids, leave them at home to run around and scream. The name says it all.</review>

	<review>Ok. i've been to this establishment probably 5-10 times. Each time I went, a reservation was already made (either by myself or a friend), but I still had to wait 30 mins to an hour before being seated. Also, a few years back I threw a birthday dinner for a friend and I had bought a cake, which I had brought with me to the resturant for the entire party to enjoy after dinner. When I got there I was told that we were going to be charged $3/per person for the restuarant to cut MY cake and serve it to us. I was outraged (back then, i think service charges for these kind of things were unheard of). So all 15 of us had to cough up another $3 bucks on top of our meal for the cake. Also, parking in the vincinity can be a pain sometimes (they have valet, though I try to save money when I can). Other than these complaints, the prime rib medium rare is fantabulous, along with the cream of spinach and the yorkshire pudding. I also tried the cream of corn during the e.coli days, which was not bad also.</review>

	<review>Incredibly disappointing. Service: We felt like we were being rushed.  The server forgot our dessert. Food: I wanted the sea bass, I got swordfish.  It's really not even close.  The other four ordered prime rib.  Each order was overdone.  The salad was soggy from too much dressing. Drinks:  Quite a long wait to get our order I had only a couple nibbles of my food and had them box it up.  I figured it's too expensive to waste and I'll have it for lunch.  My discover this morning...  A hunk of fish in a plastic container.  The asparagus, potatoes, and creamed spinach were missing.  I just don't understand this.</review>

	<review>4.5 Stars. The Prime Rib was delicious, perfectly aged, chosen from a great stock, and roasted slowly and to our desired doneness. The creamed corn (not on menu) was adequate, the fresh baked sourdough bread was good, the yorkshire pudding was lovely, and the cornbread was a surprise addition. All in all, still remains our top steak choice for the bay.</review>

	<review>UPDATE: May 21, 2008 It's true, I do come here this often. I request John as my server - remembers exactly what we want and always great - and we also spend some time with Peter at the bar. Honestly, couldn't find a nicer group of folks and some great prime rib. I have officially graduated to the big girl cut - the House of Prime Rib cut. Delish. --------------------------------------------------­------------------- UPDATE: May 5, 2008 I still love this place. Really, I do. The service is always great from the bar to the table, they attend to your every need. Always super prompt at getting you served and just the nicest people ever. Amazingly enough, I also love the sides as much as I love the meat. The starter salad is delicious - it might be the beets, the dressing or that special house seasoning salt but I just love it. My standard order is the English cut, baked potato (with sour cream, butter and bacon) and creamed spinach. I'm already dreaming about going back... ------------------------------------------------- Really, you should only go to HOPR if you want and love prime rib.  The meals are ridiculously large, and the price is just right.  There are various cuts - from the King Henry to the City Cut (I think that's the smallest).  I usually go with the English Cut which is the "Goldilocks of cuts" (in my book).  The cut prices range from the low $30s to high $30s but the sides are included (unlike most steakhouses) - and these are phenomenal and amazing sides. You'll be tempted to fill up on the salad but you have to save room for the Yorkshire pudding and the creamed spinach...oh yeah, and the prime rib!  I can't even remember what the potato option is because I always get the baked potato - with all of the toppings (sour cream, butter and bacon for me), it's more like toppings with a side of potato.  For all of your non-pig eaters, the creamed spinach has bacon... And if you're still not full from your meal, the waiter will come by your table and ask "is everybody full here?"  If you reply with "no", they'll bring back a second, thin slice.  Back, back in the day it was "all you can eat" (aka you could keep asking for more), but that must've gotten expensive.  Only ONCE did I get a second slice; I was short of breath as my stomach smushed my lungs.  I have never had dessert here because I never have any room left after the entree.   It's true - the wait is long, but I always go with a reservation.  With a reservation, sometimes there's a bit of a wait, but I actually like the old school, lodge-like feeling waiting room.  It's warm and cozy, and the bar is pretty decent.</review>

	<review>Not normally a place I would go since I'm not one to order cuts of meat out. I've very particular about how I like it prepared and my tastes can be rather pricey. Regardless, it was a business trip and this was a night out with coworkers to unwind after a day of the conference grind. I was glad I did it. The main dish (I had the English cut if I recall) to the bread was just excellent. The salad was a real surprise. Such a mix of things (including beets) and a specialty house dressing. The atmosphere was great as well. Set up like a house with different dining areas; walls with bookshelves, a nice sitting area with fire for drinks . . . It was overall a very pleasant evening.</review>

	<review>As good as it gets in San Francisco as far as prime rib.  You can order seconds!!!!! (shhh it's a well known secret-I've even ordered thirds) Based on price vs taste + good service, this place takes the cake. Beautiful dining room, large celings, antique decor, gorgeous bar and lounge, always full of people having a wonderful time, families, couples, friends, I love this place. The prime rib is oooh so good, sliced fresh at your table. Never bothered to try anything but the prime rib. Why bother? yorkshire pudding to die for, huge house salad with every meal tossed fresh at your table.  Baked potato with all the fixing, mmmmmmmmmm, you know what i mean baby! The excellent veteran staff will always make you feel at home no matter what you ask for, and they have a beautiful vintage wine list. Very large place, big enough for large parties. Valet parking. Everyone loves this place, it's always full at dinner rush, but I've never found it impossible to get a seat even when the reservations are all full.  Just chill at the bar/lounge, and wait for 30-45 mins.  Trust me, it's worth it. You will go home satisfied.</review>

	<review>My favorite restaurant in the city.  I love coming here on special occasions.  Not that it has to be for me to come here, but it's definitely a good excuse to.  For the price you pay, you get perhaps the best prime in the city, and it also comes with a great salad (of which I've been trying my best to replicate) and also the warm sour dough bread that just completes the entire meal.  The menu is pretty straight forward, it's the house of prime rib and people that go there usually order that.  However, if beef isn't your cup of tea, they also have a fish and chicken dish on their menu. I ambiance is in the restaurant is rather dark and always crowded and loud, even on the weekdays.  So if you are expecting a nice candle light dinner with that special someone, be prepared to speak up a bit otherwise there will be a lot of "what?" and "huh?" all night.   Service is excellent.  Even with a packed house, the waiters always stay calm and frequent your tables a lot to make sure you are enjoying your dining experience.   Do make a reservation before coming, and bring a big appetite.  Never have I seen a person leave this please unsatisfied.  And if you're lucky, you might see a celebrity or pro athlete dine amongst you that evening.  I have.</review>

	<review>I'm a native San Franciscan who has been celebrating my b-day at House of Prime Rib for the past 8 years. It's become tradition because they have the best prime rib in the Bay Area. The prime rib is delectable, like butter melting in your mouth. I recommend that you do not go for the a la carte dish because the salad, and other sides are yummy! So you don't want to miss out. It's a shame that there are a few poor reviews posted because I've never had a bad experience (nor have any of my friends). The service is exceptional but it's true that reservations are needed or it could take 1-2 hours before you're seated.</review>

	<review>Went again the other night. I couldn't believe how busy it was on a Tuesday night!  We had a 7pm reservation and the place was jumping with all sorts of people. Getting a booth is good because it is fun to people watch or meat watch (since the chefs are traveling around the room with this large cart of meat) Great Service, Great Food. Just don't eat too much during the day. And here is a good tip: Although the warm bread they serve is good and the salad is so delicious, you have to PACE YOURSELF. So you have room for the prime rib.</review>

	<review>This would be the perfect place to dump that vegetarian girlfriend/boyfriend of yours. I grew up in central Wyoming and we raised cows.  Now most of you probably think of cows as big hairy sacks of hamburger, but really they are like really stupid dogs (and for you ladies, they can lick their eyeballs while they are young!).  They have distinct personalities, likes, and dislikes, but what they all have in common is the dream to be part of the House of Prime Rib experience. I never understood this dream until tonight.  The pride they must feel as parts of them get to ride in the silver armadillo... We arrived at "Cow Heaven" and waited for the rest of our party to join us.  As we waited we chatted with the wise and witty bartender who introduced us to "the best beer in the world", which was really pretty good. Then the meal began, the waiter brought out a terrific salad artfully prepared table-side and some quite good sourdough bread.  This was followed by the MEAT.  For a very reasonable price you can get huge slabs of the best prime rib I have ever eaten along with potato (baked with sour cream, chives, and bacon bits, or mashed with gravy) and some creamed corn or spinach. Once you wrap your self around a 16oz slice of heaven you can ask for "seconds", which while not as generous as your first portion is enough to test whether or not your skin can stretch any tighter. After dinner naturally comes dessert.  I had the cheesecake...It too was wonderful.  It had the perfect texture, not hard, not jello'y.  We had to order them to go since you can't possibly still be hungry by this point. Then the helpful valet caught us a cab and sent us off into the night, with the cab scraping bottom every time we hit a bump. When you go, and this is not an 'if' proposition, make sure to allow for a couple of hours of dining pleasure.</review>

	<review>Absolutely amazing! Very simple menu. You get big meat, small meat, regular meat or thin sliced meat. There is a non-prime rib option on the menu as well but why I ask :) I try to find excuses to eat there as often as I can afford. You get a second serving of meat if you can eat it. But you can't take your second serving to go if you can't finish it :( The creamed spinach is delicious and the bread pudding. The mashed potatoes are divine and the gravy kind of creeps into everything on your plate. Truly delicious! The best prime rib I've found! Call and make your reservation! I need to go again.</review>

	<review>One of, if not, the best, steak I've ever eaten.  I ordered the King Henry VIII cut, medium rare (of course).  That's how steak should be eaten.  It was so flavorful, so tender...ridiculous, and the flavor...wow.  Everything else that came along with it, the cream spinach, Yorkshire pudding, and the salad were all great too.  I like how they added bacon to the spinach.  My GF got the House of Prime cut and she loved it too.  I'd definitely come back here again...just don't expect to go in and out quickly.  You're probably going to be looking at a 2 hour wait time or so, so be prepared for that.  It's worth it.</review>

	<review>Went here in Dec of 2007 when I came back from a year tour in Korea.  Asia is definitely not the place to get a steak.  For those that don't know by the name of the place, the only thing that one should get here is the prime rib. I started out the night with a perfect kettle one and tonic which was reasonably priced for a restaurant in San Francisco.  Then in about 15 minutes we were moved to our table. The night starts with a salad and their own house dressing.  I found that the salad was a little too salty from the dressing, but it was fresh and good none the less. The main course comes with potatoes and a choice of creamed corn or creamed spinach.  I chose the spinach but after tasting the corn I found the corn more tasty. As far as my prime rib, I chose their king cut which was the largest one and got it bloody rare.  The Yorkshire pudding helped soak up the blood and was quite tasty.  This is the first time that I finished a whole steak with all the sides in quite some time.  There definitely wasn't any room for a desert.  As far as the wine goes, I found their list mediocre for a nice restaurant.  We had a nice Cake Bread Cab which I enjoyed, but I found the price a bit high. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, however I must warn you that they do use MSG, which is why I did not give them a full 5 stars.  It was only in the salad, but I could definitely taste it.</review>

	<review>Yum Yum Yum.... I love those juicy prime rib. It's not a fancy place, but the atmosphere is decent. I have been there from time to time and this place has never disapointed me so far. Just make sure to make a reserveration if you're going in during dinner hours. Ok, so their salad seems to be a little soggy. Their fresh baked sourdough bread is a definitly a plus. Crispy on the outside, soft in the inside. I usually order the King Henry cut, medium rare, mash potato, and corn. And if you're still hungry, dont forget to ask for a second thin slice. Now how many place would actually offer you that?</review>

	<review>Love Love Love IT! There was time in my life where I cut out red meat...what the hell was I thinking! The service is great, decor a bit dated...but the food is excellent! The bf and I came here just because we were craving a hearty slice of prime rib...hah something I've tried to make but it never really taste as good! We both ordered the King Henry cut (since thats the only cut where you can have another piece!)...I managed to stuff my face with salad and bread I could barely finish my first cut. Good thing my bf managed to clear out all the meat!! We left happy and so content! Cheers to HOPR!!!</review>

	<review>So..what's the big deal about this place? For those who think the prime rib here is the best, you need to go out for prime rib more often. The novelty is that they wheel this big cart around with half a cow in it and they cut the prime rib to order. This place has a legendary reputation for prime rib as evidenced by the crowds. It's also a tourist attraction. Times have changed and many other restaurants provide a better value for prime rib. Half our table of 8 didn't feel satisfy with the prime rib (lack of flavor, too much fat) and we're talking about $32 to $40 each for prime rib. We asked the maitre'd about all you can eat prime rib and he told us you can only get 2nd's and you have to eat it at the restaurant. No 'to go' bags. We had 2 college students who wanted seconds and were disappointed when they were served with a thinly slice of prime rib that was no thicker than a piece of lunchmeat. Maybe in the old days, this was the place for prime rib. It's not anymore. It's not worth the wait, so if you come, make a reservation or do down the block to Harris Steakhouse and get a steak instead.</review>

	<review>Last month i came in with some friends for a dinner of about 15-20 people. It was a very different experience. Chefs came and carved the beef in front of us which i thought was very unique. the only thing that really ticked me off was the service...  Ask for something and they would handle other customers before me.. we spent a putt load of money that night and couldn't even get a little quality service.*sigh*</review>

	<review>Our group of five had dinner at HOPR to celebrate a friend's birthday. On the car ride there, while everyone was debating which cut of prime rib they should get, I was debating whether I should get prime rib at all. The short &amp; simple backstory is that I just started eating steak regularly three years ago &amp; I've always order filet mignon b/c it contains very little visible fat. I'd never had prime rib before. I tried a piece of my friend's end cut (it was cooked medium) &amp; decided that while it was non-offensive, I wasn't going to be able to eat $34 &amp; 10 ounces worth of prime rib... So I ordered the salmon which was wonderful! Cooked all the way through, but still tender. The star of the evening was my Grey Goose dirty martini. I loved that for $14, you basically get the equivalent of two drinks because your glass comes with a tumbler. Salty &amp; strong--I was a very happy girl. To top it off, we befriended a diner at the next table who sent over a bottle of Cab. Im not a red-drinker, but it would've been rude not to drink, so down the hatch it went! Three stars because their entire menu consists of things I never eat (prime rib) or things I only rarely eat (fish.) My loved ones enjoy prime rib, so I'm sure we'll be back. Love the classic SF steakhouse atmosphere, the professional service &amp; the tipsy-making martinis. And that, is the story of a girl who went to the House of Prime Rib, but didn't order prime rib. You may boo &amp; hiss at me now.</review>

	<review>I came to this old-school eatery with family for my grandma's birthday, as she is a meat and potato girl. The good: Good prime rib that is carved right in front of you, so there's no doubt as to the freshness thereof. You can request certain pieces and watch them being carved before your own eyes. The Yorkshire pudding and creamed spinach were tasty companions to the meat, if not low-fat. The House of Prime Rib is a splurge, to be sure, both calorie-wise and cost-wise. Sadly, our experience was marred significantly by a nearby table of loud, rude, extremely crude young people, perhaps dining there prior to a prom. I couldn't believe how inconsiderate they were - I was embarrassed that my grandma might have heard their totally inappropriate conversation. The place is just too intimate and small for that kind of brash blabber. Whatever happened to common decency? Conclusion: The restaurant has a very old-fashioned feel. I'm not sure I would return of my own volition, but I think the older folks really love this place!</review>

	<review>I appreciate the House of Prime Rib for its vivid introduction to fine dining in 1957. From the simply prepared ultra-red meat (cooked to the rare side of medium rare as I like it) to the simply prepared baked potato with classic topping selections, everything is just as Donna Reed would want it for Paul's big business dinner. My modern day palate did struggle a bit with the mayonnaise-based salad dressing, probably prepared from a retro copy of Betty Crocker's iconic red book. My biggest regret is that our table opted for a few bottles of red instead of going full Mad Men with some gin gimlets or vodka rocks. Not for me, but a cool experience nonetheless. Wear your best vintage.</review>

	<review>3.5 Stars. Good prime rib, but I've had better. Where? At Lawry's in Socal and Vegas. Although I really can't eat that much meat, I decided to get the 12 oz. House of Prime Rib Cut coz I'm such a glutton. I really should have gotten the 7oz city cut, but for $2 more I wanted the option of possibly having a 2nd slice. I barely finished half my meat, probably because I filled up on so much bread, salad and sides. The sides were alright. I got the mashed potato over the baked, creamed corn over the creamed spinach, yorkshire pudding and corn bread. Pros: 1. Pretty good meal for the price. The quality of the prime rib is excellent and the meat is quite flavorful and the price includes all sides 2. You can get a 2nd helping of meat (all cuts, except the 7 oz. City Cut) Cons: 1. The dining room is SOOOOOOO incredibly LOUD. I could barely have a conversation with my friends and the 4 of us sat in a cramped booth. 2. Salad was too drenched in sauce. Ask your server to go light on the dressing. 3. It's reservations only. You can't just waltz in and expect to be seated.... unless it's 10pm on a weeknight. My meal was $60 after tax and tip - House of Prime Rib Cut plus a glass of pinot noir. I'll be back again someday, but not someday soon.</review>

	<review>Looks as if the economy has caught up with HPR.  Questionable quality as well the introduction of the shrinking ray gun has now entered the once formidable HPR. I went there with a small group (4/6/2010.)  The prime rib was under cook (per my request of medium), lukewarm, and iffy quality.  The side's are a joke.  All side dishes were baby portions at best, but very good. Usually I will say something about the food or service, but a dear friend was taking us out on his dime.  For his sake I kept quiet. In all, I'm not coming back.  There are too many other places that offer better quality even with this bad economy.  Afterwards the other party members did concur with my evaluation.</review>

	<review>I am glad I finally got to come check this place out. My sisters have briefly mentioned it, and I have had friends who talked about it. Luckily it was my moms birthday and she LOVE'S prime rib so we decided to come here to celebrate her special day. Our reservations were at 7:30, but you wait for a good 15-25 minutes after. Luckily they had a nice waiting area and a jar full of snacks. The waitress came out, offered to take some drink orders too while we wait, very nice. FINALLY we were seated and I must say, you get a lot for the price. You get salad, bread, a corn bread thing, prime rib, cream of corn or cream of spinach, baked potato and/or mashed potatoes. Everything was delicious, but to be honest, everything was phenomenal BUT the prime rib. For some reason I was hoping for it to have some amazing taste or flavor but I didn't really taste anything in my prime rib. Everything else tho was good. I had the cream of corn and mashed potatoes. I really liked all the sides, and salads but yes, the prime rib wasn't that amazing IMO. Maybe its because I got medium rare? I don't know. The good news is whichever size cut you choose to get, they offer you a second thin slice. Tho I must admit, the second slice I got was pretty big ( I had originally ordered the H.o.P.R. cut). As for the service, it was good...but nothing super amazing. They were attentive but not THAT attentive. I can't really explain it, but then again, perhaps I am picky and also a customer service snob too. (Since I work at Trader Joe's, I KNOW customer service). Oh, if anything it should cost $40-$50 a person without drinks, including tips. Overall, I liked the food. However, being called House of Prime Rib I wasn't super impressed with the prime rib itself. Service as I said was good but nothing super amazing. So if I could, I'd really rate HoPR a 3.5 out of 5 stars. Its not quite a 4 or 5 yet for me. Sorry :-/</review>

	<review>Setting:  A mix of elegance and party atmosphere.  Kinda hard to explain, but you can bring a date here and have a romantic dinner...or bring the guys and have a party.  The tables are a bit close to each other, but not to the point where nobody can pass between the seats.  There's a nice waiting area, bar area, and the bathrooms are very well kept. Food:  This has got to be my favorite prime rib place in the city.  I highly recommend the English Cut.  It's pretty much the same size as their "bigger" cuts, but thinly sliced.  I think this works well as the flavor easily seeps into the meat.  I'm not a big salad fan, but the salad here is to die for!  The chef walks around with a cart and cuts the meat in front of you so that you know it's very fresh.  The meal comes with salad, mashed or baked potatoes, creme of spinach or corn, and bread.  It's a bit pricey (~$45/pp, more if you include alcohol), but it's totally worth it. Service:  The waiters are very nice, very friendly.  And please don't short change them on tip like we almost did (case of the split the bill between cash and credit card confusion on our part), because these guys work hard to please. Conclusion:  There are 3 prime rib/steak houses practically in the same block as House of Prime Rib...I highly recommend this place out of the 3.  It won't disappoint!</review>

	<review>Nice looking restaurant, very old skool "San Francisco," good service, and good food for those carnivores who enjoy MEAT! I honestly used to consider myself a meat and potatoes gal but I'm now completely convinced I'm really not that into MEAT. SPARTA!!! was the first word that came to mind when I sat down and had a very manly meaty meal. That was immediately followed by The Flintstones because my friend next to me said that she was only eating the bone and taking the rest of her dinner to go. The bread &amp; cornbread were warm and tasty but I'm giving the house salad a C grade because it had beets in it and to me that's a very questionable vegetable for a house salad. Almost, like serving lamb at a banquet dinner for 200,  ya know? It's definitely pricey, can accommodate large groups, has comfortable lay out, and drinks were pricey but strong and rightly so because it's hard to get a little buzz on when eating so much. Oh, and BIG UPS to our server Laura(ie) for tossing a mean salad and not getting a drop of salad dressing on us.</review>

	<review>A couple of days after Christmas, my husband finally got his wish-to eat at THOPR. We were a party of 8 as we always are when we are with my in-laws(and 8 is enough). Our joke because each of the sons have one child and one wife. Anyway, we had early reservations for 5pm and since we came over in two cars, we waited in the bar area until the other folks arrived. The restaurant is old school and there is already a ton of reviews on the decor and food but I will say that is was nicely decorated for the holidays and has a warm feeling. The lowdown: -Service was fantastic and efficient. -Sourdough bread and butter is tasty -Corn bread is thin, limp and not worth the calories/filler/anything-skip it. -Salad is the same for everyone and has lettuce, beets, hardboiled egg and pimentos. It also comes with a delicious salad dressing and is tossed table side. The 11 year old nephew claimed it was the best salad he had ever eaten. Also, they were very accommodating and made a separate salad for me as I do not eat hard boiled anything. -Prime Rib (though not the best I have had) was delicious. I did not like that my plate had a ton of au jus on it and next time, I will make sure to ask for it on the side. Rare is rare and husband was very happy! -Creamed corn was delicious and had a little bite-the spinach was just okay and I wouldn't have it again. -Baked potatoes are also prepared table side and was yummy as were the mashed potatoes. I got lucky and husband had the mashed so I got to taste and I hogged the whole baked potato for myself. -The coffee is just fair but the cheesecake was really yummy (though not made in house). For our family of 8 the grand total including tax and tip reached $400.00. Granted no alcohol was ordered but we did have sodas, iced tea and 4 desserts. Daughter claims she doesn't ever need to come back because she didn't like the sides that much but husband is already pushing for the next trip!</review>

	<review>Been here a few times and its YUMMY!!! i Love it here, however the taste does get old and eventually it'll just get boring.  But i love love the spinach and mash potatos....The seconds to the steak is delicious.  its just a shame that the doggy bags actually do look like shitty doggy bags...C'mon now, we're paying good money for food, at least invest in some type of to go boxes instead of just wrapping them in aluminum foil and throwing em into a bag.  Also they don't let you have the spinach and potato to go which i think is retarded.  Other than that this pricey extravagant rest is well worth every amount =)</review>

	<review>Ill start off saying that I truely miss that old school feeling you get when you go into a restaurant. It required a certain reverance. It marked that this was a special occassion. Now all these trendy ultra mod restaurants make you feel like a backstreet boy just for eating there. Im talking about the restaurants where the bar is full of San Francisco's $30,000 millionaires who just got off work at Macy's. That being said, House of prime rib is wonderful and truely feels like an old school restaurant. This is one of the places I like to take out of town guests for dinner. You get so much good food for the money. I promise you that you will not leave there hungry. The service was always very nice the few times Ive been here.  I would say that this place doesnt give me any reason to rate this place any thing less than 5 stars.</review>

	<review>i gotta be honest, but their prime rib just doesn't razzle dazzle me.  however, together with the jalapeno corn bread and wonderful accompaniments it makes a pleasant meal after all.  the side dishes include creamed spinach, a delighful yorkshire bread pudding, and mashed potatoes (of course!).  their salad is also out of this world.  i like beets now because of their salad!  and the dressing...it's like a thousand island w a kick (worchestershire sauce, i believe).</review>

	<review>If you enjoy prime rib "House of Prime Rib" a must visit. We arrived on a Saturday evening with no reservation and after a very pleasant wait in the elegant bar and lounge we were seated in the exact amount of time the host said it would take for a table.   Our wait staff was excellent and even introduced us to our carver for the evening that spoke about the different types of cut that we might enyoy.  After only reviewing the menu for a moment our minds were made up we both ordered the house cut and enjoyed every bite.  The meal includes the best salad you have ever had, creamed spinach, choice of potato, and Yorkshire pudding. If you are visiting SF or live here and never been call make a reservation and don't miss the best prime rib ever.</review>

	<review>It started out innocently enough -- My family headed here to celebrate my dad's birthday, and thought a nice dinner at HOPR was the perfect thing. Well, it indeed was, but it turned out to be one of the most fun nights we'd had in a while, complete with kisses and hugs from our server and the manager(?). We were seated right away in this weird front table with a plant that I think was supposed to give us privacy, but just served as something that our server, S, kept getting caught in. We cracked jokes, she cracked jokes, there was wine, followed by booze, follwed by some of the best prime rib I've ever had in my life. And cream corn. And SUCH GOOD SALAD. And then the S introducing us to her boyfriend and them getting into the group picture with us. It was awesome. So awesome. And, yes, the night was as hectic and blurry as this review. It definitely made my dad's evening and that is not easy to do. Unfortunately, it set our expectations pretty high for the next time we go, and for sure there will be a next time. As we got up to leave, we got huge hugs and a kiss from S. This was a first for me, so I think she enjoyed us as much as we enjoyed her and the restaurant. Well done, HOPR!</review>

	<review>I love the ambiance of this restaurant. Great bar, with sports on the TV. Plenty of room to walk around, stand, and mingle with other people. In the dining rooms, a little tight in terms space to sit down without waiters bumping into you, and you can hear everything your neighbors talk about, but still very good.The best part of the night, the PRIME RIB. I ordered the biggest cut available, and I must say, the best tasting prime rib I've ever had. Not only that, but the best cream spinach as well. Biggest surprise: the cornbread given to all customers while they wait for their meal. Very, very good. The only reason this place didn't get a 5 was the prices. I only come here for special occasions because of that.</review>

	<review>First of all, there's always time for drinks at this place - even when you have a reservation, which by the way if you're going to eat here and want to make reservations, better do it quick, they fill up fast!! Anyway, yeah, the drinks are great at this place and reasonably priced. We had a martini and they leave the little shakers there with you so you're refilling your own glass as you drink it - pretty neat huh? So then, they take you to where you'll be eating the best prime rib EVER!! I mean, it's what they do... PRIME RIB!! And they do it perfectly!! You simply do not leave this place feeling hungry or dissatisfied. We brought my inlaws there this weekend and they've had some good prime rib before but NEVER as good as this! The House of Prime Rib simply knows how to do what they do and they do it BEST!</review>

	<review>The service was great. The steaks were tender and prepared just right.  The cream of spinach was delicious as well. The place was packed with people, every table was taken, but service was prompt, friendly and helpful.  We had a very good experience.</review>

	<review>A nicely decorated restaurant with a nice lounge that includes a fire place to enjoy drinks in. Despite the reservations we were seated about 20min after which wasn't a big problem cause it was a Saturday night and I can understand how busy a place like this could get. They sat us at a corner booth so it was nice to just kind of sit amongst ourselves without having to worry about people bumping into us or what not...and Mr. Steve was very polite with taking our orders and making sure we were having a pleasant evening. So onto the food, I ordered the regular HOPR cut, I was really thinking about getting the King Henry but I figured I really I didn't want my last meal to be at HOPR. So I played it safe and decided to stick with the regular size piece..my lady got the City cut a bit smaller but just perfect for her. Figuring that I am probably the 895th review for this restaurant I'm quite sure all of you already know what the prime rib comes with so you guys could just skip this part..BUT for all you who have not been here yet. The prime rib comes with a nice salad that includes beets and eggs that they  fix up in front of you. I have to say the salad was delicious, a little too much on dressing but it was still quite good. The two sides we got for the prime rib were mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. The mash was  good, and the spinach was better. Both very good additions to the Prime rib...Oh and I forgot to mention, they also give you a piece of Yorkshire pudding on top of your meat. Overall the place was very nice, the food was delicious and we had a wonderful time. I have to say, it was my first time at HOPR and I was very pleased with how everything turned out. It met up to the expectations I got from reading the reviews of others and especially since Grace K. said it was INEXCUSABLE that I had never been here. I dont think I will enjoy another prime rib as much as I enjoyed it at HOPR.</review>

	<review>Came here with a party of seven for a birthday.  Even with a reservation, had to wait about 25 mins, but this didn't really bother me because it's got a cool, lounge-y vibe and strong drinks.   We finally got seated and proceeded to have some of the best prime rib I've ever had the opportunity of tasting.  The salad was also a standout, as it was made in a large bowl tableside and the dressing was very yummy and unique...slightly creamy and spicy. It's expensive, but isn't that to be expected?  You get what you pay for here, and in this case, it's worth it.</review>

	<review>I've been going to House of Prime Rib for over 20 years, and the last few times have been disappointing.  The food is still good, but it takes longer than it used to, and it can get very LOUD (even on a Tuesday night).  Also, it's gotten quite "pricey" for the atmosphere!</review>

	<review>I was surprised to walk in to what I thought was a fancy steak house to find most of the patrons dressed in t-shirts and flip-flops. We went there for our anniversary so I was dressed up and I felt right at home among the plush seats, but kind of weird compared to the other patrons who are a mix of very old, and very young and almost all, very casual. The food was good, if you like prime rib you should go there. Our waitress was nice and although they said they wouldn't box up my second slice, I stuck it in the box they had already given me on the sly. It ended up going to a homeless guy but I'm sure he really enjoyed it! We had a great romantic time, only a 20min wait for out reserved table - not too bad, just enough time to hang out in the lounge for a drink without getting bored. It didn't get 5 stars because it didn't totally blow me away, but if you like these sort of cheesy ":experience" restaurants it's a good place to go.</review>

	<review>I got a reservation that was one month out via open table.  My reservation was for 8:30 on Saturday and we arrived a little early (no traffic...yah).  We used valet parking which is highly recommended.  We checked in and managed to find a seat in the lounge which was very busy.  We ordered drinks at about 8:15 but didn't get out drinks till about 8:40.  We were finally seated at 9:05.  Because of the wait, they comp'd our first drinks that we ordered in the lounge.  We all ordered the King Arthur's cut and a bottle of wine.  The service was good but overall, slow.  It was so busy and everything sort of trickled.  Dinner took 2 hours, not because we ate slow but because it took that long for things to arrive.  But when the food came, oh, it was worth the wait.  The Prime Rib is the best!  I ate my entire King Arthur's cut and got an additional thin cut (at no extra charge).  I was in meat heaven. We managed to make room for dessert.  I got the English Trifle which was refreshing (lots of raspberry, blueberries and blackberries).  I was disappointed a bit that it was mostly fruit topped with whipped cream.  I like to order stuff I can't easily make at home.  Our friends ordered the crème brulee and loved it. Make reservations well in advance of when you want to go, use valet parking, allocate 3 hours for dinner and expect amazing Prime Rib.  You won't be disappointed.</review>

	<review>The House of Prime Rib is an average steakhouse.  I LOVE Lawry's in Beverly Hills, so I was expecting the same quality of food.  It took about half an hour to be seated and then an additional 20 minutes before the bread arrived even though we had reservations.  I'm used to waiting, since it takes about the same amount of time at Lawry's.  However, Lawry's is worth the wait while I can't say the same for this place.   When we were seated, I noticed that the plates had black scratches on them which made them look dirty.  Also, the glasses they gave us looked really old and had hard water marks all over.  To top it off, the fork my boyfriend got had a piece of green vegetable on it.  I would expect a restaurant costing $$$ to use clean dinnerware. The bread and butter was good, but nothing out of the ordinary.  The sourdough bread was served hot, which is great because I love it when the butter gets soaked up by the bread making it especially scrumptous. The salad was decent, but I thought they put too much dressing.  The creamed corn is nowhere close to that of Lawry's.  Corn straight out of a can would've been sweeter and more flavorful.  The creamed spinach was average.  I ordered the baked potato, which was topped with butter, bacon, chives, and a mountain of sour cream.  I love sour cream, so that was a plus.  However, I expected a bigger potato since most other restaurants I've been to give you a potato the size of half my head while this potato was only about the size of my fist (and I have small hands).  My boyfriend ordered mashed potatoes, which were very good.  Our waiter forgot to give us the yorkshire pudding so we didn't receive it until we were almost done with the meal.  The pudding would've tasted better if they weren't burnt on the bottom.  The prime rib, I must say, was VERY good.  It was cooked perfectly and had wonderful flavor.   This place would've gotten a higher rating from me if the wait was shorter, the service was better, it was cleaner, and the corn was edible. I will definitely try other steakhouses in the area before resorting to coming back.</review>

	<review>This place is it when it comes to great prime rib. The interior has all the trimmings of an old east coast steakhouse. The staff is very attentive and given that we did not make reservations (oops) they made us feel invited as they offered us drinks and bar snacks while we waited. As for the food, its all about prime rib here, sure they have bread and English pudding, but is the big cut of meat that people come here for. I had the King Henry cut with the bone in. The meat is absolutely addictive and the horseradish is HOT HOT HOT. Most places give you horseradish cream and trust me its mostly cream.   One downside to this is the limited items for non-beef eaters or anyone not in the mood for a big slab of red meat.</review>

	<review>Hate to do this... but need to report a sub-par experience at HoPR. Been several times before and loved it, but last night the service just fell apart (food was still quite good). 8pm RESERVATION on a Tuesday night Show up early -- not seated until 8:35pm Worst table in restaurant -- chair literally put my head in a tree/bush Unbelievably slow service  waited to order  waited for salads  waited a long time after salads finished and cleared before prime rib (and why, its already cooked and ready to go?!?)  finished prime rib, wanted to get the famous second slice -- waiter could not be found for over 15 minutes!  finish meal, again no sign of waiter for over 15 minutes It was after 10:30 when we finally could pay our bill and leave the restaurant, which is absolutely ridiculous when you don't have dessert and nothing on the menu is cooked to order. Really sorry to see such an awesome restaurant have such a terrible night.</review>

	<review>Although they serve chicken and fish (often only one type of fish cooked one way), I would recommend ordering... the prime rib! I'm sure that was a surprise given the name of the restaurant. The menu is limited, but this makes the experience that much better. There's no fooling around in terms of what to get and what's good. You come here for one thing - the prime rib. You get your choice in terms of what sized portion you want. Personally, I always get King Henry the VIII. It's huge and comes with the bone attached. In my younger days, I could put this down no problem. However, these days, I often have some leftovers for the next day. Yum! Here's how it works. When you're waiting (sometimes the wait can be a bit long even with reservations), you can get a nice cocktail for starters. They have this awesome nut mixture you can munch on, but beware of getting full. It's delicious and will fill you up in no time. Once you sit down, order your sides and what type of potato you want (I highly recommend the loaded baked potato over the mashed potatoes). You first start with some bread - again, be careful not to get full. They bring out a huge salad, where they spin it and add some dressing to it. The salad is absolutely delicious, and also a bit dangerously filling. Next, comes the loaded baked potato. This thing is huge and a meal in itself. Finally, the cart comes around, and your meat is sliced off fresh and served on a plate. Presentation may not be great, but the taste is wonderful. I always order extra au jus on the side for dipping. YUM! If you're still not full after your order, you can get a thin but satisfying slice - it's basically a second order. You can even get more creamed spinach with it. You won't leave hungry, and it's a great deal for the price you pay. I highly recommend making reservations, especially if you come on the weekends. Parking can also be pretty tough to find. They offer valet, but I've seen them park cars in some pretty sketchy areas before (e.g. in front of a fire hydrant).</review>

	<review>It's been a long time coming. I have wanted to come here for about a decade now and I finally made it. I don't know whether my expectations were too high but I was underwhelmed. My sister and I were driving around SF looking for a place to eat when I brought this place up as an idea. She seemed keen on going so we drove over hoping that it wouldn't be too full considering it was President's Day. We showed up right when it opened and we were sat almost immediately. We got a table right in front of the fireplace which made me feel a wee bit uncomfortable since I was there with my sister and it was the day after Valentine's Day. But hey, it's better than waiting a long time for a table. The décor reminds me of sitting in the lobby of a National Park Lodge. There is plenty of dark wood paneling and old furniture to go around. The waitress came over and greeted us as soon as we sat down. She was nice but she seemed a bit flustered about something. She brought a nice and hot piece of bread, asked us whether we would like still or carbonated water, took our drink orders, and gave us the run down of how things work since it was our first time there. It's pretty simple actually. You choose your prime rib based on how large you want it and then you choose between mashed or baked potato and creamed spinach or creamed corn. The meal automatically comes with salad and Yorkshire Pudding. The wine list was quite extensive, but my sister and I decided to go with beer and cocktails. The place had a nice selection of bottled beers but I opted for the Anchor Steam since its San Francisco. My sister ordered the Lemon Drop and it actually comes to you in a shaker which has about three martini glasses full of alcohol. It had a bit too much simple syrup in it but you can't beat the price of $9.25 considering how much you get. The first course was the salad. They do this thing where they spin the salad bowl around and pour the dressing and pepper in while it's spinning. It's pretty lame and the salad is not much better. They give you a ton of salad; too much for one person to eat considering all the other food you are going to get. The best part about it is the beats. There was a lag of 15 minutes in between us finishing our salads and us getting the rest of the meal (prime rib, baked potato, creamed spinach, and Yorkshire pudding). I probably would not have noticed but unfortunately my sister is a bit impatient and felt the need to alert me to it. The waitress first brought out the baked potatoes and proceeded to put about three pounds of stuff inside of it including butter, sour cream, chives, and bacon. It's definitely not something you would eat if you were on a diet. Then Chef Victor brought out our prime rib and creamed spinach. The creamed spinach tasted like something I could get at any other restaurant. The prime rib was cooked well and it was extremely tender, but still not much better than anything else I've tasted. With the prime rib comes three different horseradishes: a mild, a medium, and a hot. I think a better representation would be not horseradish, not horseradish, and horseradish. I didn't eat much of the Yorkshire Pudding because I was full and I couldn't fit any more starches into my stomach. But it was nice and flaky and reminded me of unsweetened French Toast. Cost: $109 for an Anchor Steam, Lemon Drop, and 2 House of Prime Rib Cuts</review>

	<review>My friend took me back here last night for an absolutely fabulous dinner. There are not many dishes that make my friend groan with pleasure, and the prime rib here is one of the few. I don't think I can ever have prime rib anywhere else. I've tried it at other places like Lawry's and it just doesn't measure up to HOPR's standards. The prime rib here just melts in your mouth. The salad is awesome too and the presentation is unique. The server brings the salad bowl to your table, drizzles the dressing while spinning the bowl. An attention grabber for sure. I love the Yorkshire pudding, the creamed corn, and the baked potato that all comes with the prime rib. They now also bring out cornbread, which is tasty as well. All in all, I just love House of Prime Rib. I am so glad I am back in the Bay Area so I can go here more often because there's just no other place in the world where I have found prime rib as succulent as I have here at HOPR. I LOVE this place!</review>

	<review>Growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area, the House of Prime Rib became something of a yearly tradition that my family would go to the weekend after Thanksgiving, usually on that Friday after when we'd go into town for tree lightings and such. However, when I moved away, the memory grew fond and the visits infrequent. After almost a decade hiatus, our family went back as a toast to tradition and I was reminded exactly what I loved so much about this place. Everyone waits a little bit, yes. Reservations are a must. All things that I don't need to repeat. The food is what makes this place special, not the wait time in the lobby. You start off with a salad made with their house dressing. Their house dressing is absolutely fantastic. Even the strict carnivores in our family (the kids who don't quite dig the green vegetables and are fighting to grow into them) will scarf down this salad. The extra touch of being topped with egg and beets adds a subtle extra kick. The prime rib itself is great. It's tender and flavorful as you'd expect. The Au jus is perfect and goes great on those fine whipped mashed potatoes. Either of the vegetable sides (corn or spinach) are great choices. The Yorkshire Pudding is a treat as well. Obviously, the menu isn't one filled with variety, but it you want a nice meal and everyone is on the same page, I can't think of a better place to start.</review>

	<review>I had been waiting to go to House of Prime Rib for a long time, as my friends had hyped this place up to the max.  I have never met a piece of beef I didn't like (I'll say it before you do - "That's what she said."), so I was expecting to be blown away by the culinary stylings of the meat masterminds at House of Prime Rib.   It was good.  The salad was good and my baked potato was a king of baked potatoes.  I had a taste of my friend's mashed potatoes and they were just eh.  I could make better. The prime rib itself was everything it should be. I ordered it medium rare and it was excellent, but I was not wowed, especially for the exorbitant cost of the meal.  I think the best prime rib I have ever had is at the Wynn Buffet in Las Vegas.  Less than $30, PLUS all the other lovely trappings that come with a top notch Vegas buffet.   If you are ever in Vegas, GO TO THE WYNN BUFFET.  Every time I hear that my friends are making a trip to Vegas I tell them to go there, and every time they come back and thank me for having changed their lives.  I am not kidding you.  I've heard that some people have even accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior at the Wynn buffet.   Sorry, I didn't mean to wax nostalgic about the Wynn buffet while writing a review of HOPR.  My apologies HOPR, that was rude.  I just miss Wynn buffet so much *tear* ANYWAY, back to business.  I would have given this place four stars, but there was one glitch to mar an otherwise pleasant dinner.  One MAJOR GLITCH, worthy of bumping this bitch down to two stars.  I was the only person at my table who ordered a soft drink, and when my first one arrived, it was in a tiny glass that was about 8 inches tall and about 3 inches across in diameter and filled up to about 6 inches with ice.  Needless to say, I finished my Cokes very quickly (I usually only get through one glass of Coke with a meal, maybe 1 and a half max, and a lot of the time I don't even finish my first glass).  Anyway, I had to keep asking the waiter to refill my glass each time I finished.  Not really a big deal for me, I don't fault wait staff for not automatically refilling my drink.  However, I realized that there was a reason that the wait staff don't automatically give you refills of your soft drinks when the bill arrived and there were SIX MOTHER EFFING COKES LISTED ON OUR BILL.   WHAT.  THE.  FUCK.   As I mentioned, I was the ONLY ONE at the table who had ordered a soft drink, so all six Cokes WERE MINE.  This couldn't possibly be a mistake....you can't ACCIDENTLY put six Cokes on one bill.  They ACTUALLY CHARGE FOR EACH REFILL.  And not only that, EACH COKE WAS FOUR FUCKING DOLLARS.  WHAT.  THE.  FUCK.  If I ever go again, I'm bringing my own goddamn 2 liter bottle, and if they want to charge me a corkage fee for it, they are welcome.  It will end up being cheaper than getting refills anyway.  Loss of two stars for that bullshit is warranted. p.s. I should add that my party decided to split the bill evenly six ways, so the five friends that I dined with ended up shouldering my astronomical soda bill. My guilt is further compounded by the fact that every single other one of them just had water.  Thanks, Mike, Ben, Kristine, Nik, and Kevin.  I owe you guys.  I had no idea HOPR would shaft me in that manner, I swear.</review>

	<review>This has got to be the best Prime Rib dinner I've ever had!! From the time we got here till the time we left, it was a wonderful dining experience. The service was great and our server, Teresa really made sure we enjoyed our dinner. I had the House Cut and if you finish it, you can get seconds!! Your dinner includes choice of baked or mashed potatoes, creamed corn or spinach, Yorkshire pudding and a house salad. The salad is prepared and tossed tableside and it was very good.  But the prime rib was so tender and juicy, cooked and carved just right. It is carved tableside from a special cart that makes it's rounds throughout the restaurant. The sides were also delicious and I recommend the mashed potatoes with gravy. I look forward to returning to House of Prime Rib on my next trip to San Francisco.</review>

	<review>3.5 stars I'm not all about the prime rib.  I'd choose steak over prime rib any day.  People say prime rib is juicy and flavorful.  But I say a perfect rib eye cut of steak is even tastier.  When people go to buffets, they horde the prime rib station.  When I go to a buffet, I stick to the seafood and desserts.  Basically what I'm trying to say is, prime rib is not really my thang.  Which is probably why I never had the desire to dine at the House of Prime Rib.  But that's not to say I wouldn't turn down an offer to eat here if someone wanted to treat me, which leads me my first ever dining experience at this well-known San Francisco establishment about a month ago. If I were a lover of prime rib, I would really dig this place.  But for the mediocre interest I have in these slices of beef, I would have to admit that this place isn't so bad.  The old school dining room feel, the elbow rubbing as a result of close seating quarters, the good service, and the decent food, all resulted in a nice experience.  From start to finish, I thought everything was better than average.  The sourdough bread, the salad, the cornbread, the creamed corn, the Yorkshire pudding, the horseradish, and the prime rib.  I went with the A La Carte portion, which not only gives you everything the normal entree gives you (except for the salad), but is cheaper and also fills you up real good.  If you're really itching to have the salad, just bring some kind and generous people with you so you can steal a few bites off of them.   The wait for our table was kind of annoying though.  We made reservations for a certain time and didn't get seated until 30 minutes later.  It seems like the norm here so that you're suckered into buying pre-dinner drinks in their waiting area aka lounge.</review>

	<review>What a wonderful place for a special birthday dinner! Especially during the holidays, when House of Prime Rib is so gorgeous! It's like visiting a country house in the English countryside, except that the food is fabulous and the service is extremely friendly and accommodating. Yes, it is a bit pricey, but the House of Prime Rib delivers a memorable experience, serving only the highest quality beef with equally delicious side dishes. (I love the mashed potatoes.)  Of course you'll end up taking home the cute little red bag, because there's no way you can finish everything! The portions are more than generous, but if you can, save room for dessert, even if you split one between two people.  We tried the apple crisp and the berry trifle - both were fantastic!   Definitely make reservations!</review>

	<review>I don't get what the big fuss is over this place.  Sure you get a lot of prime rib, but it's not a particularly fantastic one and it's kind of expensive.  But then again, this could be because I'm not a huge fan of prime rib... Their sides aren't all that great either.  The only things that are really good are the bread (warm and round that you slice yourself) and the salad (they mix it at the table for you). If you aren't big on the prime rib, there's no reason to come because they don't have a lot of non-prime rib dishes.  But my friend just ordered a baked potato, so you can always do that too. And if you're getting the dessert - because really, what meal is complete without it - do NOT get the trifle.  It was just not good here.  Reminded me of Robitussen actually and there is absolutely no need for that taste when you're no longer seven-years-old and sick.  But the chocolate cake-cheesecake thing was pretty good.  Or just go somewhere else for dessert. However, if you like prime rib, you should at least try it once and decide for yourself if it's worth it.</review>

	<review>When House of Prime Rib (abbreviated as HOPR amongst my friends &amp; I) is mentioned, the following words come to mind: mouthwatering, succulent, juicy, tender, and oh soooo hearty!! Come here with an appetite because you'll be leaving with a VERY happy and satisfied stomach. Located right on the busy street of Van Ness, there is Valet parking available. An easy $10 bucks can save you the hassle of circling around &amp; around for parking. The ambiance resembles patrons who fine dine with wine, a little older atmosphere...but don't be intimidated. The service is always good, friendly faces and nice smiles from ALL the staff. As for the food...they start you off with soft, warm bread just waiting to be buttered. Warning: don't load up too much on the bread because there is definitely more awaiting your attention. The salad is simple, but there's something about the slices of beets and yummy dressing that always has me finishing the entire plate. Your slice of prime rib, which I might add has been roasting SLOWLY ALL DAY in its own natural juices, comes out. It is soo tender and juicy that each bite must be slowly savored. It comes w/ horseradish (opt for the spicier one), good old mash potatoes (or the baked potatoe w/ all the fixings), creamed spinach, and yorkshire pudding. (Tip for the carnivorous: if you opt for anything other than the thinnest prime rib, you can ask for another slice of prime rib.) If there's still room for dessert, or even if there's not... make room!!! The creme brulee is AWESOME! It's decadently creamy with just the perfect amount of sweetness, and that carmelized top layer finishes the dessert off right! TIP: Don't skimp, go all out when eating here....basically HOPR=INDULGE! Your tummy will thank you in the end. :)</review>

	<review>My friends all hyped this place up and after reading the yelp reviews, I was so excited to come here. I was literally counting down the days. Boy, was I wrong. The food is average. I really didn't like the salad (the dressing tasted so weird; I don't think I've ever had such a bad salad at such an expensive place before) or the creamed spinach. The cocktails were very poor. My mojito was just sour and had way too much mint. The service is poor to good, depending on which server helps you. We were a pretty large group, at least 30 people, so we had two servers. The young man was AWESOME! The older man was very rude. I asked him if he could add more sugar in my Mojito and he just hands me the sugar from the table. What kind of service is that, especially at a place with such a high reputation? What's worse is neither server EVER, EVER asked to replace my cocktail. Both servers saw me adding sugar to it and taking out the extra mint, but NEVER ONCE asked me about it. The young server hooked us up with the second slice of prime rib even though we didn't order the large sizes and joked with us. He was very attentive and sweet. He was the only saving grace of the night.  The food cannot even begin to make up for the horrible service here. For a place with such a supposedly excellent reputation, how can they act this way? I seriously think it was because we were all really young (under 30) and thought  we wouldn't put up a fuss. We came with such a large group so the gratuity was over $200 so you can imagine how much the bill was. I think there are, by far, better ways to spend your money and get more out of it. Like the transvestite hooker with no teeth that's waiting down the street.</review>

	<review>I decided to break the Asian Food Review spell and review the HOPR only because I feel the need to tell how awful it was. I really don't understand how this place is viewed so fabulously. I will break down the pros and cons (it did deserve two stars, after all): Pros: Fun! This place is great for big family dinners or get-togethers with friends. It's warm and dark and cozy and makes you blissfully sleepy. I definitely did not have any problems with the quantity of the food nor the attentiveness of the wait stuff (that's what the two stars are for) Cons: Even if you make reservation (HIGHLY recommended) you still end up waiting around for 30-45 minutes to get your table. But even the waiting isn't what really did me in. The quality of the food, in my opinion, was not good for what it was. I don't remember the exact cost per person, but I know it wasn't inexpensive. The flavor of the meat wasn't rich and some of the sides were dry or sloppy. It felt like I was being served cafeteria food! For two days, my mom and I nearly overdosed on Rolaids. Neither of us could sleep that night as our insides were aching and burning. I felt like someone had struck a match underneath my esophageal opening. I will never return to HOPR even if the meal is free. It's not worth losing sleep and feel like I've been invaded by fire ants.</review>

	<review>My favorite restaurant to eat at when I'm in SF for business (hurray for expense accounts!).  While I think Lawry's in LA is significantly better I do like the fact that the entrees are served with a side order (the cream corn is solid) and its a little cheaper than a dinner at Lawry's.  If your a big fan of the meat and potatoes set then I highly recommend eating here when in SF.</review>

	<review>Wonderful wonderful prime rib that makes you leave with a huge grin and the belt loosened a notch or two!! The salad and sides are pretty good as well. The menu says something about thin slices being tastier but don't believe the lie! Get the huge King Henry cut since the difference between this and the smallest cut is a mere $5. There's always a wait (at least 15-20 mins) but they're pretty good about the service once you get seated. The $7 or so valet is totally worth it because parking in the area is pretty much non-existent (don't even bother circling around).</review>

	<review>An excellent American Continental steakhouse featuring none other than the wonderful prime rib.  Solid multi-course menu, where you meal is based on the selection on the size of cut you want.  Your meal would include salad made table side (with the big swirling bowl and everything), sides of creamed corn, spinach, mashed or baked potatoes and Yorkshire pudding, and the prime rib cart going around the dining room carving your selection right to your plate.  The sides were great and the prime rib was EXCELLENT.  Perfectly flavored and cooked piece of meat that satiated the carnivore in me.   The service was excellent and very attentive - exactly what I expected for this type of place.  Doing those little things like clearing out our plates at just the right time and delivering our plate of prime rib with the restaurant logo facing the proper direction is a sure sign of attention to detail and overall high quality of service.  Our waiter did a great job making sure we got what we needed, and even did a little something for one of my dinner partner's birthday. I'm drooling just thinking about this place.  I could sure use a good cut of prime rib right now.  Good thing this place isn't near me or else I'd be in trouble.</review>

	<review>I used to love this place.  I considered meals here to be legendary back in the day. We used to tell tall, camp fire-esque tales about the mighty beef zeppelin and how dinners could last well over 3 hours. Aahhh, those were the days.   Lately though, I feel this place might have become a little too popular.  Damn you, Anthony Bourdain... We took a couple of first timers here last night.  I'm afraid we may have over-hyped the place, but they swear they enjoyed their experience.  The food is as great as its always been, but the service...well, here's what soured the whole visit for me: *Upon introducing himself, our waiter promised to bring us a lovely, warm round of sourdough bread.  None came.  Later in the meal, we asked for some bread.  "You'd like another loaf?", he asked.  "No," we replied, "we'd like the original loaf you were going to bring us before our salads". *After everyone had taken a chilled salad fork, our waiter flipped the napkin off of the plate in dramatic Benihana fashion, splashing the plate's condensation on myself and my friend.  Several drops went directly down my cleavage.  Awkward. *My friend said he'd like a small second slice after his initial dinner.  The waiter seemed to heckle my friend a little, trying to determine whether or not he really wanted more.  After confirming that yes indeed, he really did want a second slice, the waiter left, only to return with no meat...and dessert menus. *I ordered coffee for dessert.  Our waiter brought cream, asked me if I would like cream, and then took the cream away even after I said that I would take the cream. Easily the strangest dining experience I've had at this place.  Plus, everyone in the very near vicinity seemed to have ordered the fish.  Fish. At the House of Prime Rib.  Please. But no matter how loud tables of people get (hint:  you don't need to shout at someone that's sitting right next to you) or how inconsistent the service has gotten, one solid person remains...and that person is Pete the bartender.  He is always friendly and will make you a killer drink.  Plus, its been over 2 years since we've been there, and he remembered us!</review>

	<review>I been always wanting to come here, but out of randomness and hunger, we came here for a very late dinner after our Impressionism museum tour @ De young. At first I was bit guilty having to arrived only 15 minutes before they close. To my surprises, the restaurant is still pack with people. That make me feel much better. Luckily, since it was so late. We barely have to wait long. The hostess in the font desk were extremely polite and we were seated quickly. Hooray! Since we were starving. Three of us end up ordering from the a la carte menu since the only difference is no salad. Recalling yelpers talking about how much food they gave, I was pretty sure a la carte was enough for us. I ordered my prime rib medium rare the English cut, while my other friend order hers the house of prime rib cut. The last girl order a salmon a la carte. (plus mushed potatoes and creamed spinach) Personally, I really enjoy my prime rib. I like how it is flavorful and juicy. As in comparison to the house of prime rib cut, which is much chunkier. I much preferred the English cut. My friend on other hand, likes her better than mine. The mushed potatoes and creamed spinach were OK. Nothing to brag about. Salmon was done right as well. The salmon were the same price as the prime rib ($32 dollar a la carte) The hostess once told me that, if they only sale one thing than it better be good. I much agree with him. But honestly, I had better prime rib elsewhere before. For that I am bit disappointed! The house of prime rib in my opinion did not live up to it's name. Good but not the best. Prime rib plus wine plus tip... appx $50 per person.</review>

	<review>hands down, this is one of my fav steakhouses of ALL TIME.  make reservations beforehand because this place gets pretty crowded.  i always get the house of prime rib cut and the meals all come w/ salad, mashed or baked potato, creamed spinach or corn (the corn is bomb) , yorkshire pudding (never was a big fan of this) and of course, horseradish sauce.  people say don't fill up on the salad, but it's such a good salad!! the meat itself is always tender and cooked to perfection.  i've never had a bad slab of meat there, and if you're not stuffed after all that, you can even have seconds!  definitely a must eat if you're in the city.</review>

	<review>Came here as part of a surprise and was really impressed overall. He's been talking about this place FOREVER, so finally when we were going to be in the area, I made reservations for us to have dinner there. Prior to being seated at our table, we waited at the bar for our names to be called. I love how if you order one of their shaker drinks it comes out with the drink and the entire shaker! I think I got 2-3 glasses out of that one order. The lemon drop was delicious and strong, great way to start the meal and I love the sugar rim! After being seated I ordered the house cut while he got the king henry cut. With our meals came: - salad (i loved the dressing, sooo good!) - prime rib (perfectly cooked- we got ours medium rare) - creamed spinach - yorkshire pudding (his fave!) - mashed potatoes I love how they offer seconds for most of the cuts if you wanted it. Even as a crazy eater, I couldn't even finish my house cut! The old man that walks around is super cute and so nice asking how everything was. Fantastic food, great service and awesome company- fantastic experience.</review>

	<review>The name says for itself.  Of course with that type of name brings high expectations and overall service.  This restaurants meets those expectations and then some.  If you get there earlier than your reserve time, you can mingle or just have a drink at their bar.  Nothing fancy, just your average bar.  Once you get to your table, they warm you up with the salad, in which your waiter makes on your table  This all you need with the appetizers because their salad is the probably the best ones I have ever had.  I recommend to eat half of it and save the other half for the next day because you need room to eat the main course.  You got four choices of prime rib.  I have been here twice and ended ordering the House of Prime Rib cut on both occasions.  With this selection, you will get that juicy flavor of prime rib and good enough portions to fill you up.  But to be honest you cannot go wrong with any of the selections because they seem to have their own unique taste.   I would give five stars, but the hassle of finding parking and ending up to valet it gave it four stars.  If you are willing to spend some extra dough on valet parking, be my guest, but if you do not want to have that as an option get there early, probably about an hour before your reserve time at the restaurant and just start looking for parking.  Other than that, you will enjoy the food, service, and probably experience.</review>

	<review>This IS my favorite restaurant. If you want to buy me a present, get me a gift certificate from the House of Prime Rib. The Prime Rib is cooked to perfection with the best prime rib or steak taste, ever. You must make sure the try the horseradish in all three varieties (mild, medium, and raw)! Personally, I like mixing the mild and medium together on each bite. My wife loves the raw stuff. The cut to order is the English cut as it has the best flavor! The sides to get are the mashed potatoes and the creamed spinach. Oh, and how could I forget the best salad you will EVER eat? It is served with beets, special salad spices, and a mouthwatering dressing. Okay, that's it, I can't write any more, I have to go get in my car and head down there now before I eat the photos of the food on the Yelp site! One last note: make sure to call for a reservation because I am clearly not the only one who knows about this place.</review>

	<review>honestly i don't really get the hype on this place.  i mean the prime rib is ok - good, but not oustanding.  you can argue that it's great because you always know what you will get, but i don't think it's that hard to turn out the same thing every day.  it's a SF institution so if you live here and love meat you have to try it, but it's not my first choice to take out of town guests to give them a little taste of the city.</review>

	<review>My City Cut was good (but FYI, my BF's English Cut made him a little on the queasy side). Anyway, the service was less than desirable and the wait was completely unacceptable. We had a party of 10 yesterday and made reservations well in advance for 7:30pm, we went to the lounge and had a drink and then waited. Eventually we went to the host's area and asked if they could check on our reservation, by then it had been about 45 mins. Still no table. They told us it would just be a minute, they were setting up a table... almost 30 minutes later (not quite "just a minute") we were seated. Our waitress asked us if we wanted beverages, I requested a glass of wine - she came back several times with water, sourdough bread, and corn bread; but no wine. 30 minutes or so after that the waitress took our orders. I couldn't believe that it literally took almost 2hrs for us to sit there and order. Unreal. Oh! Not only that, we had ordered our drinks in the lounge and paid in cash for them there, and the bartender came to our table and wanted to recharge us for the drinks that we ordered, saying he didn't recall us paying - when we most certainly did. I just thought overall the service was bad - from the bartender, to the loooonnnng ass wait, to the latency in getting our orders in. We didn't leave the House of Prime Rib until around 11:30ish! That's just flat out ridiculous. If you don't mind waiting close to 2hrs for just okay to good food, this is your place.</review>

	<review>I love House of Prime Rib.  My sister loves House of Prime Rib.  My friends love House of Prime Rib.  I don't know anyone who doesn't love House of Prime Rib.  I drool even as I type and think about all the food! What can get better than a delicious, juicy cut of prime rib with side of cream spinach, Yorkshire pudding, and more?!  The dinner starts off with house specialty salad that is hand-spun/tossed at your table.  I don't know what they put in that seasoning but it sure is addictive!  Then they roll out the metal cart with a huge slab of prime rib and slice it to order.  Topping the tender, tasty meat with freshly made horseradish cream equals heaven. I can't wait to go back again.  If you have not tried it yet, it's time for you to run down there (so you can work up an appetite) and get yourself some prime rib!</review>

	<review>If you value customer service or believe in that timeless phrase, "the customer is always right", please AVOID this restaurant! I've frequented House of Prime Rib a few times before, taking out visiting relatives and or friends. Even though you make a "reservation" you still have to wait 20-30 minutes after your so called "reservation" for a table. Not a big deal, I understand the place gets busy and it's hard to estimate how long people will occupy a table, fine. However my last experience with House of Prime Rib was absolutely horrible. I took my wife out to dinner for her birthday. As expected we waited 20 minutes after our reservation to get seated. From that point on it just went down hill. Our waiter basically ignored us, he served on other tables who were seated exactly the same time or after we were (yes I pay attention to that kind of stuff). Every 15-20 minutes our waiter would come around saying, "I'll serve you with the next cart", only to see the cart skip us with our waiter no where to be found. In the end our sides where late and cold, and we waited well over an hour before we were served our cuts of prime rib. To say the least I was not impressed with their poor customer service. Since I didn't want to come across as a chump who is just trying to complain their way out of paying the tab, I still paid the bill and gave the waiter a much undeserved tip. When I asked to speak with the manager, he just kept discounting our complaint and said we were exaggerating the amount of time we were waiting even before confirming with our waiter. The manager finished it off by basically saying, "when you come back next time things will be better". This just aggravated me even more, what an arrogant SOB. So their manager told my wife and I that we have to comeback later, spend another $100+ for them to maybe provide us with better service. When I asked him, why don't you make it up to us now, (something I originally didn't plan on asking for), the manager lied to me as if I'm some kind of idiot and said, "oh we already processed your credit card and we can't reverse it". In the end, while House of Prime Rib has good food, they're not the only good prime rib/steak house in town. A month later my wife and I went to Harris, just down the road, and we were treated to a great steak and customer service.</review>

	<review>What a big disappointment this place turned out to be. You hear all the hype about this place that the steak is so good, blah blah blah. I found nothing special about this place. I figured, well if they are the house of prime rib, that must be their specialty. Meh, tasted like any ol' prime rib. I had my meat with a side of creamed spinich. I almost barfed.  It was so rich and none too good, I didn't finish it. Oh, and should I go on about the wait to get into this place? Its crazy! You think its the line to meet and greet the Queen of England or something. Save it and go to Harris' or Ruth Chris. Its so much better there.</review>

	<review>To celebrate finishing my MCAT, I ate here with a bunch of friends on someone's recommendation. After a long drive from Davis, we found parking easily enough a block from the restaurant. They also offer valet service for those who are too lazy to look for a garage. We had reservations, but were running late. They gave us a deadline to meet that we just barely met, but wouldn't seat us until the entire party arrived (6 people expected, but only one was missing). The service, at that point, should've tipped me off. Our server was energetic but annoyingly so. He wasn't so much helpful as slightly condescending. When it came time to toss the salad, which was pretty good actually, he tossed some onto my girlfriend but didn't apologize. The meat at the restaurant is thinly cut to keep the meat moist and juicy, but more impressive steak houses have equally good--dare I say, better--pieces of meat that are also much more substantive. The sides tasted terrible, as well. The atmosphere was loud and crowded and unpleasant overall. I was pretty disappointed with the trip to the restaurant and I would've rather spent time with my friends at somewhere closer and less obnoxious. ==== Rubric: 5 = Mindblowing 4 = Excellent 3 = I see the charm 2 = Disappointing 1 = Never again</review>

	<review>Best place for prime rib hands down. Tender, juicy, cuts like butter.... mmmm! They cut it right there in front of you, pick the prime rib off of the side menu... it's a medium cut (which means you can get seconds if you're still hungry) and it comes with everything, but the salad (and it saves you a couple of dollars). *** Don't come here unless you want meat. There really is nothing else. &amp; don't expect there to be tons of sides like at those family restaurants... this place is just basically meat with some things on the side (they really are "sides" and not mounds of veggies, potatoes, etc). The food was great, I wish I had more Yorkshire pudding, and our waiter was a little quirky, but it was overall a great experience. They were also really accommodating after we pushed our reservation back twice that night.</review>

	<review>Went here with the gf for our anniversary dinner.  It was the 1st time here for both of us and we were pretty excited due to all the hype we have heard about this place.   This place is crowded.  Be prepared to wait even with a reservation!  My gf and I arrive on time for our reservation and waited about 30-45 mins before we were seated.  At this point I wasn't too bother by the wait because I expected it to be crowded and places like this always overbook reservations.   Our server was really nice and helpful but it took forever to actually put our order in and finally get the food.  Combined with the fact that street parking around HOPR has a 2 hour limit which meant that I actually had to get up from the table to move my car even before we got our food! 2+ hours to get our food for 2 people with a reservation?!? That is unacceptable. As for the food, my gf got the English Cut while I opted for the King's Cut. =) What can I say, I'm a carnivore!  For the sides we had the yorkshire pudding, creamed spinach, creamed corn, mashed potatoes and the baked potato.   Everything was just....okay.  What is all the hype about?!?  The prime rib was semi-tender but lacked flavor.  The potatoes, creamed corn and spinach were nothing special and the yorkshire pudding was a lesser version of bread to soak up the juices from the prime rib.  Got a complimentary dessert from our waitress when she found out it was our anniversary which was kinda nice but the dessert wasn;t that great either.   IMHO, my Mom makes a much better prime rib at home every Thanksgiving or Christmas and until I find something better, I'll be waiting for that for my prime rib fix.  HOPR, you let me down...=(.</review>

	<review>While i was checking out Yelp for places to eat at while in SF, i needed a good meat place. And HOPR seemed like it fit the bill, seeing as how i LOVE me some prime rib. So we made reservations for a Wednesday night. There were 5 of us. We were seated right away. It took a bit for the waitress to come by(couple minutes max) and give us our menus and take our drink order. No big deal though, as we were busy checking the place out and i was staring at the meat cart as it rolled by. One thing i should note is i was ordering vodka martinis in a rocks glass, but the glasses were pretty small, not the usual size rocks glass, which i was fairly disappointed in. If i am paying ~10 per drink, give me a full size glass please. So we all ordered the prime rib, and waited patiently as the rolling meat carts kept tauting me. They were toying with my emotions, and i had to distract myself by talking to my coworkers, which is definitely a step down from what i was dreaming about in those carts. The salad that came out first was good. It was spun table side, just like at Lawry's. The salad was pretty good, although i thought the beets were a bit on the overdone side for me. But overall a very good salad. When we got our main courses, i was not disappointed at all. The beef was cooked perfectly to my medium rare liking, and it was very tender and juicy. My creamed spinach was good, but not great. The pudding was good too, although could of used maybe some herbs or salt in it, although i am not sure it traditionally it has any of that in it or not. The horseradish came in three varieties, from mild to hot., which was very nice as i am all about very hot horseradish. Boy did that clear up my sinuses, in a good way. If i find myself back in SF in the future, i will for sure stop by again. the prices were pretty good, ~40 for the food per person, which was reasonable for the quality and amount that we got. Oh, and our waitress was very nice. She was funny and did not flinch when an older coworker of mine somehow blurted out "toss my salad". She had no idea what she was saying, but the rest of us, waitress included, had a good laugh at that.</review>

	<review>A restaurant is more than just about food: it's about ambiance and staffing. For that, I give House of Prime Rib two stars - the ambiance is, well, fair (and it always seems dirty to me). Well, the bathroom was old and gave an air of dirty. And, sorry - if I call to make a reservation, pretend to be happy to hear from me and be nice. But, well, each time I call, it must just be easier to be rude and curt for the woman. As for the food? Eh. The salad was salty, the prime rib was not marbled enough for me, and while I know you get seconds, etc, I was still not satiated. And, well, I've had much better prime rib in other cities, at other steak houses. If you do only one thing, do it so it's beyond amazing ... and they aren't doing it that way.</review>

	<review>PROS: Best Prime Rib! Best Baked Potato! My mouth is salivating as I write this review...oh how I miss the taste of the perfectly cooked prime rib! The bread was perfectly toasted and warm, served with spreadable butter. The Baked potato is loaded with sour cream, butter, lots and lots of bacon! (very important) There are many different cuts of the prime rib which is served table side. I had the light cut which was perfect for me and my boyfriend (the major meat eater) ordered the regular cut and he was stuffed! I almost wished I had a wheel barrel to roll him out of there! LOL We finished off with the English Trifle! (like the one Rachel made on friends) haha. Two Thumbs Up! Our waiter was perfect! he knew when to make a joke, he was very pleasant and made our first experience a memorable one! CONS: It gets very busy!! Make reservations! You can come early and grab a drink in their comfy lounge! FINAL ANSWER: GO! GO! GO!</review>

	<review>Okay I admit, first thing you should know about this place is that it's pricey! I go here on 3 occasions, Valentine's day, anniversary day and someone special's birthday. I always make reservations for it's more convenient that way. First off the atmosphere is very very dark with artificial candles. I was honestly not into any meat before until I came here and realized that meat could taste so good. Going to the house of prime rib is something that I ALWAYS look forward to. Yes, the meals are from $35-40 per plate but they make it all worth it. I love the salad here, spinach, corn bread and the bread pudding and I love my loaded potatoes here. They really load the heck out of it. Of course you can watch them tossing your salad (Actually they turn the salad bowl really really fast), loading your potato and cutting your very fine slice of prime rib. The creme horse radish is so bomb I cannot even describe how good it is. This place has infinite list of wine selection. Okay maybe not infinite but they have a lot. I don't drink but for people who love wine I think it's really good. They also sing for you for your birthday. Haha Overall, prime rib is very very very juicy, soft and melts in your mouth. Service is very professional and precise. You can go here casual semi formal or formal. All I gotta say is, I can't wait to go back in July for my anniversary. :) They also have valet parking though I never used it and they have a cute little waiting area. Also if you finish your king henry cut, they give you a complementary slice free, sometimes really thin but sometimes really big it always depends on the person who cuts it. I've noticed that their cuts aren't always consistent one time they gave me king henry cut size for my house of prime rib cut. Or sometimes will give you smaller king henry cut so.. It really depends on the person, either way I can't finish so I pack it home. :)</review>

	<review>Went there on a Tuesday night with my girlfriend to celebrate our anniversary. The place was unexpected packed.   The service staff was friendly. The meat was a bit overcooked for me even when i ordered medium rare. But the taste of superb. Upon finished the King cut, waiter asked me if i want 2nd slice of beef, but also told me that i couldn't take that slice to go. sucks!! i was gonna have that as my breakfast the next day. what if i can't finish that 2nd slice of beef?? throw it away? what a waste! The ambience was really noisy. So, ear plugs highly recommended. All is all, i would love to go back again, if someone TREATS me!!</review>

	<review>Its ambience is old-fashionably classic, but not exactly a great place for intimate dinner. The Prime Rib was just OK. I was somewhat disappointed at the fact that our prime rib was barely warm when it was carved right out from the stainless cart.  Also, its flavor was mediocre with not much marinated crust. We've had better prime rib at Lawry's in Vegas or the Fairmont SJ's Fountain Restaurant or even Black Angus. However, service was good and so were their spinning salad and baked potato which was overfilled with sour cream, butter, bacon and chives.</review>

	<review>Was in town for work. Decided to come here at the last minute with a co-worker (we're both dudes) b/c I had heard good things about this place. It's kinda a romantic type place so ppl probably thought we were gay....we are in SFO! haha that's ok though....valet was $8. Went on a Thu and arrived around 7:15pm...there was an hour wait!! We decided to go ahead and wait it out since we were there. Hung out in the bar/lounge area which was huge....they had free nuts/pretzel mix. They were individual so no worry about sharing with a dirty patron! Had a Sapphire gin and tonic which had a generous serving of gin. Got our table, service was excellent. Menu is simple. 4 different cuts of prime rib, 1 fish dish, and sides. There aren't even appetizers. The cuts just range in size and they are all $35-$39. I got the largest one b/c I figured it's just an extra $4. Everyone gets a salad. You get to choose between mashed potatoes or baked potato and creamed spinach or creamed corn. Everyone gets yorkshire pudding. The prime rib was delicious! But not the best I've had. They have a cart they roll around and cut it in front of you. The carver had a really high chef's hat...like I wanted to grab it play with it haha. AND, they give you another piece if you're not full. How cool is that??? If I had known, I would have gotten a smaller cut....maybe the thin cut. The salad was one of the best salads I've ever had. It was so good, and the server tosses it right at the table. Co-worker got spinach, I got corn...they were both good. The best part of the meal hands down, was the yorkshire pudding. I didn't even know what it was prior to this meal....I hear pudding and I expect pudding, you know? But it's a baked pancake-ish bread-like soft goodness!! Baked fresh and brought out, yum! Overall, it was a good meal. I give it a 4 instead of a 5 b/c it really isn't the BEST prime rib I've ever had, but it certainly was good. I was expecting melt in my mouth goodness based on all I've heard....maybe it was b/c I got the thickest cut. I'd go back with my wife so she could have the yorkshire pudding....and I'd get a different cut. I have a big appetite, but wouldn't have to worry b/c I can get another slice!! Our bill came to $143 which included 3 or 4 glasses of wine, 2 cocktails (mojito was really good!), and 2 entrees. Definitely make reservations.</review>

	<review>Quick, I need some floss, PRONTO. I really want to like this place... but nothing they served here really had that WOW factor.  Now, I understand that they are serving old school, traditional food that comforts your soul but for $40/plate, I need to be wowed and I was not wowed. We came here for some aging celebration and we were told that they could only seat us when everyone in the party has arrived, so even though only one of our friends was late because he was looking for parking, we could not get seated (so you should take advantage of the valet service!!) The bread was warm! I loved it!  As far as the beet salad went - it was OK.  It was just a standard house salad with some beets and feta cheese on them.  I wish I could get more of that beety taste in my salad, but instead, we each got a few strands of beets mixed in with our salad.  They do mix salad by your table though, so you get to see how they professionally spin the salad bowl to make the dressing covering each lettuce evenly. With the salad, we got a piece of corn bread.  It was sweet and soft and warm - I really liked it but it made me feel a little suspicious... they were trying to stuff us before the main course!! When the prime ribs finally arrived, I was in the zone.  I didn't talk and just started devouring that slice of red meat sitting in front of me.  I was the fastest one to finish my food!  Of course the prime ribs were good - this is THEIR THING!  But I do find some parts of the meat hard to cut through. The mashed potatoes were OK, the cream of spinach was NOT.  It was bland.  I mean, it's already in an unpleasant green color, in an displeasing goopy form... and it had no flavor?  I wish I had gotten cream of corn instead.  I really think that even Safeway's spinach dip that comes in a plastic box is better than the cream of spinach that I had. After dinner, I ordered a tiramisu for dessert.  Tiramisu really is my dessert of choice but... it was just OK.  Very standard and by the time it got to me, it was slightly falling apart.  My friend ordered "fresh fruits" and he received in a wine glass, a glass of strawberries and ONLY strawberries.  I was hoping to see some varieties not only because strawberries aren't even in season right now, but you are paying $6 to get a cup of strawberries that aren't cut up right? The restaurant's decor is classy and sophisticated.  They have valet and coat check so even though this might not be a first-date place, it is a place you can come to for special occasions, such as Giants beating Phillies and going to World Series!!!</review>

	<review>So, it's me, my husband and my Mom! we were pretty hungry but still we shouldn't have had any lunch I think!!!! Everything was good except for the ending service, were we had to wait 20-30 minutes for the waiter to bring the receipt and our coats. pros: 1) not to many too choose from and get confusing, so you have only enough choices to decide. 2) Very friendly staff and good service...well partially 3) definitely original atmosphere cons: 1) of course on the VERY pricy side 2) not easy parking (if you don't want valet) 3) there's usually waiting time, even when you have reserved, I noticed that people that just dropped in were waiting form more than 1 hour and half!!! 4) the tables are a bit too close to each other, so if you are looking for a private cosy quality time, this place is not a good choice but great for BDs, we heard about 5 of them during the 2 hours we were there!! To give you an idea of the prices, we had 4 wine, 1 cocktail, three main dishes and 2 corns plus the bread it was around 190 (total, tax included, tip NOT included) One thing to definitely have in mind, if you ask the waiter to hang your coat make sure you get a number for it so that you won't have to wait 20 minutes for them!!! I total good experience, I will go back but after I have saved engough money again ;)</review>

	<review>HOPR is a San Francisco institution.  I always look forward to dinner there and I can't wait to return.  Basically the menu is fixed and simple:  Prime rib, potato, salad, fresh-baked bread, creamed spinach and Yorkshire pudding.  Basic choices to be made are baked or mashed potato, how big a piece of meat you want and how you want it cooked.  With such a simple menu, the food is consistently excellent.  The service is smooth and very professional.  And the bar is great, with drinks large, well-made and reasonably-priced.  For the money, HOPR has few rivals for full dinner in a San Francisco restaurant. There are a few other things on the menu for pescatarians, vegetarians, etc. but why would you bother?  HOPR is very honest about what it is.  If you're looking for a meal focused on fish or vegetables, this isn't the place. Minor note:  The creamed spinach has bacon in it, but it's not obvious.  If you're vegetarian or keep kosher or halal, you should avoid it. There's nothing else like HOPR in San Francisco, so it's often crowded and hard to reserve.  But it's always worth the wait!</review>

	<review>I've been coming here all my life.  A little less frequently as I get older, since I'm not burning it off as efficiently as I once did!  The meat here barely needs me to chew it, it's so tender.  The menu is simple, tried &amp; true, no horsing around.  Fish is available if you want to enjoy this restaurant with a non-red meat eater.   The staff is warm and friendly, and once you're seated, you're golden.  The waitstaff is so attentive and accommodating, it begs a huge tip.   I have a fantasy of hijacking one of those silver meat kiosks, hitching it to the back of my truck, and towing that badboy home for a night of slicing and savoring with some of my fellow carnivores.  Somehow, it just wouldn't have the same magic without the guy to spin my salad around in a bowl of ice. Whenever I'm feeling like tying on a good feedbag, I come here.</review>

	<review>So, I'm between a 3 and a 4 for House of Prime Rib, but our server was kind of weird, so I'm going to round down to the 3. This past thursday, my boyfriend took me here for to celebrate our being together for 3 years.  I have been telling him about it for quite some time now, telling him how much I wanted to try it and this was the perfect opportunity.   We made reservations earlier in the week for 9:30 p.m. (because we were going to CAS nightlife before).  We showed up about 20 minutes early, so we went over to the bar area and got a couple of drinks.  I had a lemon drop, which was absolutely delicious and my boyfriend had the manhattan, which he enjoyed as well.  The bartenders are pretty nice and after the pour your cocktail from the shaker, they let you keep the shaker so that you can refill your glass once your finish your first glass.  The drinks are fairly priced at about $8-9 each.  The bar also has mini-carafes filled with asian cracker mix (the bartender didn't offer any to us, but we asked and he let us help ourselves).  After about 15 minutes at the bar, a host came and seated us at our table. We got a small table to the side, next to a really rowdy larger table.  Since we had reservations, I was really hoping for one of the nicer booths, but it wasn't too big of a deal.  House of Prime Rib, unlike many other steakhouses, has a really different vibe in that it is really lively and noisy, (even at 9:30, which seems like after the dinner rush).   Our waiter gave us our menus and then took off.  It was really strange because he did not introduce himself or tell us anything about the restaurant or the menu (as I heard him do with other tables).  I am not sure if he just forgot or if he thought he recognized us a regulars or something, but it was both of our first times here.   My boyfriend and I decided to go with the King Henry Cut ($40) and split it ($7.50 split charge).  Warm bread and butter were promptly brought out to us and a man walking around with a basket of cornbread gave us cornbread (shaped like corn) also.  Soon after, the salad presentation began.  If you're curious, the HOPR website has videos and you can watch it....or you can save it as a surprise to see it live.  The salad was pretty decent.  It was tasty, but the drench the salad in their dressing, making the salad feel really heavy and kind of soggy.   After finishing most of the salad, we were ready for the prime rib.  The man with the silver prime rib cart came over to our table and cut us a huge slide of meat.  We also got creamed spinach, creamed corn, mashed potatoes, and a baked potato, as sides (all included in the price of the prime rib/split charge).  The waiter also brought a trio of horseradish sauces for us, (which we did try, but did not really care for).  The meal also came with yorkshire pudding. So here's the breakdown: Creamed spinach: pretty good, nothing special though. Creamed corn: pass, very little flavor. Mashed potatoes: smooth and covered in gravy, i liked them. Baked potato: too full to even eat it; but it did look good.  it had butter, bacon bits, sour cream and chives. Yorkshire pudding: comes out in its own pan which the waiter serves you from, pretty good, tastes sort of like a pillsbury crescent roll to me. The prime rib: tasty, huge portion, which my boyfriend and I only ate half of.  Next time though, I would ask for the end piece for extra flavor. (They'll gladly give you extra au-jus if you want). At the end of the meal, the waiter took our picture for us, printed it, and put it in a HOPR frame, which was a nice souvenir.  He also gave us a scoop of vanilla gelato (which wasn't that good, as it had ice chunks, but it was free so I can't really complain). Overall, it was a good dining experience.  It's definitely worth a try, and you get a lot of food for the money, but I don't know how soon I'll be back.   Note: -There's valet service, but we just found street parking, which was free!</review>

	<review>A Carnivores Delight! The claim: We serve only the best beef available, the top 2% of all beef marketed. Although this incurs additional expense, out Mid-Western corn-fed beef aged for 21 days, is the most tender, juicy and flavorful beef available. The verdict: True Came in a big party of 10 and was seated a tad bit later after the reservation. Parking wasn't too hard to find on the street considering this is SF we are talking about. Probably got lucky with finding a spot, but I can see it being a pain if you don't want to fork up the cash for valet. I went with the top dog of cuts, King Henry VIII cut. It's advertised to feed people with a king size appetite. I fit the bill. The meal starts off with a salad tossed in their unique dressing which I found to be delicious and refreshing. Probably a tad bit too heavy on the dressing tho. Got to get in some greens to balance out the meal and maybe wash away just a tad bit of guilt? Not too long after a giant cart of meat (I heard from a chef friend each cart costs 10 to 20 GRAND) is rolled table side and the professional slices your cut the way you want it. I ordered mine medium rare. The meat was all kinds of wonderful. You can take your pick of normal adjectives to describe meat when done to perfection; tender, juicy, flavorful, moist etc. The sides I ordered Mashed Potatoes: Your standard fair. Yorkshire pudding: Baked batter with fluffy interior to soak up all that beef juice. MmmMm. The end After you finish your meal the waiter comes around and asks if people want seconds. All the dudes were a affirmative yes. I was stuffed but could have shoveled more in me just for kicks. Supposedly if you get a particularly generous waiter he'll serve you thirds and possible fourths. The record is 5 extra servings according to our guy. Policy has changed apparently. BAH. Meal was a complete success. Dropped around 50+ bones, but it was well worth the price of admission. Do yourself a favor and get some prime rib at HOPR! Carnivores unite =).</review>

	<review>The House of Prime Rib is my most FAVORITE place to eat in the city. Ok ok, fine, it's ONE of  my most favorite spots! I'm a total meat eater and this place serves the best prime rib! The meat is tender and juicy and the sides are definite heart attack foods so you know that they taste great!=) Some people complain about the price, but it's not too bad esp since you're getting all the yummy sides along with the prime rib (you can choose two: baked potato, mashed potato, creamed corn or creamed spinach). Plus you can get seconds if you're still hungry! The only complaint I have is that it's gotten really crowded over the years so the service is mediocre. They rush you in and rush you out! grrrr.... But that won't stop me from coming back for more!</review>

	<review>Came here for my birthday and had a great time. When we got there the place was packed. So we were seated in the bar area and ordered drinks. The Cosmo came in a martini glass and we also got the shaker that was still full. So you are actually getting 2 drinks for the price of one! After getting seated we were served bread and salads. The prime rib was superb and of course we got seconds. We were too stuffed for dessert but I wish I had room to try the tiramisu. I heard its really good.</review>

	<review>I came here during the holidays with my friends, and the decorations made the restaurant so festive! I was unable to find a reservation on Opentable, so I called and was able to reserve over the phone. The wait was really minimal considering it was pretty busy on a Sunday night. We were seated in a booth, so I had a view of the entire restaurant. One thing I observed was that a lot of youngsters come here. Totally different atmosphere from Morton's and Ruth's Chris. I ordered the City Cut, medium well. It comes with baked/mashed potato and creamed spinach/corn. My friends ordered the same size at medium rare and medium. So I was able to try a bit of everything. The meal also comes with a salad and yorkshire pudding, which I didn't care for much. The sides were good but nothing to brag about compared to other steakhouses. The medium well cut was really tasty, especially infused in the au jus sauce. It was saltier than the medium rare and medium cuts.  The medium rare was also really good, perfectly tender. For some reason, the medium cut was so-so. It was our least favorite because it was a bit tougher. Overall, a nice place for dinner. Even though I'm not a big fan of the prime rib cut, this place pretty much has perfected the way to cook it. The food is decent and great service. But I wouldn't come without reservations.</review>

	<review>Been going here ever since I was in college.  As a poor college student this place to me was what I would call fine dining. Recently came back here after years of finally working and I would still call this place fine dining even though I have more paper in my wallet now.   Its a classy place with a full size bar, full wine menu, great ambiance, and great service.  Its great for any occasion but do come dressed at least casual or you will mess with the ambiance.     The prime rib never fails.  Delicious, never overcooked, melts in your mouth like butter.  The meal comes with creamy spinach, either mash potatoes or baked potatoe, yorkshire pudding and their very delicious house salad with beets that is tossed right at your table.  If you have room for more you can always ask your waiter for 2nds.  Trust me as a college student I took advantage of this.  I even got 3rds.   Make sure you get reservations or plan to make this a three hour event.  The place is always booked.</review>

	<review>hm....so yeah about this place.....i drove like an hour and 15 mins to get here from Santa Cruz with my boyfriend for an anniversary..It was his first time trying prime rib (i know he's a loser HAHA) but i've grown up eating prime rib at Lawry's in Beverly Hills with my family. I love that place and i used to love prime rib... it's not 100% house of prime ribs fault though.. don't get me wrong. but it didn't surprise me or make me go completely quiet during dinner due to satisfaction either. the one thing that did make me go "WOW" was their apple cobbler-ish dessert with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. oh and the service was really nice and friendly. I guess it's worth trying for prime rib lovers, but for me at least i think going once was enough. OH I FORGOT TO SAY! their salad was pretty good. sorry that was a definite plus!</review>

	<review>For a place that pretty much just serves prime rib, it had better be a damn perfect prime rib.  Unfortunately, this was not so. My friend took me here during a visit to SF since I am a fan of prime rib. The prime rib here was really just "OK".  I think the prime rib at the Outback is better.  This prime rib wasn't so flavorful and I ordered the largest cut which was the King Henry VIII cut but it's not really huge or anything.  I've had prime ribs almost double the size of this one haha.  A cool thing is that if you're done with your prime rib, you can ask for more of it, they give you a few thin slices more. The service was good though and all the prime ribs come with salad and accompaniments.  The salad was quite good :-). All in all, pretty much any of the prime ribs I've had prior to this have tasted better, but then again, I am probably spoiled by living in NYC and having access to all its wonderful food.</review>

	<review>This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  Don't come here without reservations or you'll wait at least an hour, probably more.  Even if you have reservations you'll probably wait 20-30min after checking in.  But it's worth it!!! The only thing on the menu is prime rib.  Ok, I think they have a fish dish, but skip it--their prime rib is the best I've ever tasted, very tender and full of flavor.  They bring a cart right to your table and slice it off (anything from rare to well-done, your choice) onto a plate right in front of you. I like creamed spinach and I order it occasionally at other places but HOPR's version is consistently superior to anywhere else I tried.  Pair that with their huge fully-loaded baked potato and Yorkshire pudding and you've got yourself one heck of a good meal.  Don't forget the fresh-baked bread, fantastic salad (mixed at the table in front of you), and a second slice of beef (if you're still hungry), all included in the price. Put HOPR's number in your cell phone so its easy to make reservations whenever you find yourself in the city.</review>

	<review>Heard rave reviews from my friends about this place and  I finally got to try it and i must say...I LOVED EVERY LAST BITE!!! So I heard you had to book weeks in advance for a reservation on a weekend and at a normal dining time (6pm/7pm).  I guess I won the lottery that day when I called the DAY OF and was able to snag a 6pm reservation on a Friday evening!  Must of picked up someone's cancelled reservation. Service: Arrived at HPR at 5:55pm and was seated immediately.  Welcomed with warm bread and water asap.  The great thing about HPR is that your meal is not just the prime rib alone but you get a complete dining experience. Our waiter was very attentive and social with us. Spinning Salad: LOVED IT!!! omg i wanted to lick up my plate.  Salad with beets!! plus their own house dressing.   Your waiter was spin it right in front of you - a bit cheezy - but the salad is amazing! I wanted more - but had to contain myself for the rest of the meal. Potatoes: You get the choices of the stuffed baked potato OR the mashed potatoes with their gravy.... DELICIOUS again  - gravy was amazing, made from the au jus. If you opt for the baked potato - the waiter will prep it for you but making sure every bite has butter, bacon, and chives. Sides: you get the option of creamed spinach or creamed corn. I LOVE creme corn, and wasn't too impressed with their cream corn...should of opted for the spinach. Corn tasted straight out of the can and heated with creme, not much flavoring. I would prefer fresh chucked kernels please! PLUS fresh collection of horseradish sauces. Yorkshire Pudding:  I usually don't eat this but i soaked up the bread in the au jus and ate a bite of it with my prime rib and it was PERFECT! Prime Rib: The whole reason why we are here right? AMAZING! i actually wasn't too much of a prime rib fan before this, more of a filet mignon  person...but HPR has changed that. The meat was roasted perfectly and the pairing of the au jus was delectable!  Additionally, I ordered the "City Cut" but it was gigantic! I think it was definitely at least the HPR cut. Extra Perk: for those of you who don't know - you can ask for seconds as long as you order the HPR cut or larger. The second helping is a thinner slice, but you definitely will not go home hungry! BIG DEBATE: so whose better - Lawrys or House of Prime Rib?! i would have to say HPR!! Does anyone know the history/battle between the two - b/c their menus are essentially the exact same...but it came down to the prime rib and the au jus for me this time and HPR won.  I will have to say the creamed corn at Lawry's still holds a special place in my heart. Told the waiter it was a special occasion when my friend stepped away from the table, and waiter surprised him with a HBD song, icecream and candle! AND he took a photo of us, and printed it asap and framed it for us to take home. Superb service! HPR made the 2011 cut for "Things to Eat Before You Die - SF" - you definitely have to make it here in the near future! Worth every penny and every lick of their au jus!</review>

	<review>4 **** for the food, 2 ** for the service cuz it was soooooo slow. This wasn't a super hard nor complex menu. I mean basically, PICK your cut! But the evening started slow to begin. I do not like how you have a reservation time and you still have to wait in their reception room. I think it's a way for them to make you order drinks, which you will inevitably do. I do like how they give you the container with your drink, which actually in the end seems like you get more for your money. I never saw the bill, so I dont know how much they cost. But the sllloooowest part was the service. The poor guy in the cart just goes from table to table slicing meat. The prime rib was definitly good, but i think we were just annoyed that we were waiting so long for our food. The salad was yummy...but beware of the MSG table flavoring salt that they wanna add. The Yorkshire pudding was delish. Will I go back? I guess since it's an institution and lately I've been craaaaving red meat. But specifically to this place? Only if I have all night to wait!</review>

	<review>I can't believe I forgot to review HOPR. I'll make this short since this place has plenty of reviews. As others said, it's an SF institution based on meaty goodness. The only tip I have to add is to ask for them to go light on the dressing for the salad cause otherwise they'll really drown the your salad in the stuff and you need room for your prime rib!!</review>

	<review>After watching Anthony Bourdaine and having heard so many good things about the HOPR, I had to go for my birthday dinner with my hubby.   We had made reservations about a month in advance on open table since it's so popular and we wanted to get in on a Saturday night.  Our reservation was at 7:00 pm and when we arrived the host advised they would find us when they were ready with our table.   We sat at the bar area and had a few drinks....our few moments of waiting turned into an hour wait (even with reservations!)  Luckily, we weren't that hungry so we didn't mind waiting- it was actually a good thing since we wanted to build an appetite, but really, if we were hungry this would have really been a huge annoyance, whats the point of a reservation if you can't keep it- really an hour?? The decor is warm...a little stodgy and old school, but expected with such a popular place that's been around for a while.  It's more of where I would see old senior citizens come around for dinner though- felt like I was at my rich grandparent's house for dinner, hehe.  It was comfy though...nice warm feel. After about an hour of drinking and people watching, we were seated.  I like that most of the seats are booths- for parties smaller than 4.  The light is dim, which is nice and romantic and our service was good.  Our waiter asked if we had been to HOPR before and we hadn't so he gave us the run down.... Basically- chose which cut of meat you want- how you want it cooked and it comes with the salad + baked or mash potato with gravy + creamed corn or creamed spinach + Yorkshire pudding.   They serve warm hot bread which is soo good.  (Side note- my favorite part was the salad- the season spices they put in there is so good and the beets are a nice touch- it didnt look very appealing but it was yumo! and the baked potato- as for the topping on the side otherwise your potato is covered in butter and sour cream....AND if you're able to down a second cut of meat after your first...they'll give you an additional / smaller cut for free, can't beat that!) The only thing I would recommend is DONT order your prime rib Medium.  I had originally said Medium Rare but the way the waiter described Medium Rare should have been how Medium was....and Medium was really Medium well.  My prime rib was a bit dry- and my hubby's who got his Medium Rare was soooo good and perfect!  I was jipped with my cut!  He also go the King cut which was so good as it had the bone in....to me, the meat near the bone is the best part!  The prices for each cut is all about the same, close to $40- so I would just order the King Cut and take the rest home. I didn't get the fresh baked corn bread everyone mentions- it seems it came out right after our meal was done- so oh well....maybe next time. I did see a group get a Polaroid picture taken so we asked for ours.  Just a little cute memento of our first time here on my birthday- which was nice.   Overall, I can see why everyone would love HOPR.... BTW, someone wrote that they were told they couldn't take their left overs home- just the prime rib, but the sides were not allowed?  That's not true.  I had them pack up all my sides and my prime rib and I didnt even have to ask- they offered to pack it all for me.  So maybe that person who wrote that review had a rude waiter....but no worries- you can take your left overs home, c'mon you're paying for it.   I'm glad I tried it, but probably wouldn't make an effort to go back.  There's a lot of places that have excellent prime rib and great sides- so this is one place I can check off my list of "to try"   Would I go back?  Probably not....at least not if I'm starving and had to wait 1 hour after my reservation.  Geez!</review>

	<review>I just love. This. Place! Such good food, service, etc. If you like prime rib, I would say that this is the best place in the city to get it. HUGE slices of meat, plus cornbread, salad, yorkshire pudding, potato, plus creamed corn or spinach, all for under $40. Now, I can't eat here very often as I'm on a strict diet, but is such a good place to treat yourself and your friends for some good all-American food. Reservations are HIGHLY recommended and will make your meat experience much more enjoyable. But, if you do have to wait, theres a nice bar area with trail mix :-)</review>

	<review>3.5 stars for HOPR.  I think that HOPR needs to institute a policy of actually seating people at their time of reservation - I mean, what's the point of having one if you don't get seated until 40 minutes past your reservation time?  Just a thought, but perhaps they should re-assess how many people they can handle in a night.  In any case, it helps that they have a large waiting area/bar where we were able to watch the Warriors game, get a drink, and eat some snack mix to stave off the hunger pangs. What is good about HOPR is that once you are seated, things move quickly from there on out.  I really enjoyed their salad, which was prepared tableside by the waiter with a flair.  The lettuce was fresh and came with a delicious dressing.  Being the carb lover that I am, I loved their fresh sourdough loaf.  It was a little hard to cut into, but it was warm out of the oven and delicious with a little of the leftover salad dressing. I had the city cut of prime rib, medium rare and it was delicious.  A little fatty, but the meat was tender and juicy.  What really did wonders for the meat was the horseradish, which comes fresh (HOT), medium creamy, or mild.  I like to mix the hot and medium, since hot alone can make your sinuses clear up in a hurry and medium is too weak.  My favorite of the sides was the creamed spinach.  The creamed corn was deemed a tad dry, while the mashed potatoes were just okay.  The little corn bread, which is shaped like an ear of corn, was good.  I'm still not sure what Yorkshire pudding is, but it was tasty with a little au jus. For dessert, we shared some pecan pie a la mode and bread pudding.  The bread pudding was pretty bad - it was way too dense and heavy on the cinnamon.  Luckily though, the pecan pie was delicious.  My only other complaint was with my coffee, which was not served very hot -it was more on the lukewarm side. Overall, an okay experience.  The food is good, but I hated having to wait beyond my reservation time.  Our waiter was attentive and friendly so service was not a problem.  One last pet peeve: We had told them it was a birthday party and when the time came for desserts, they lit a candle on one of our pecan pies and sang "Happy Birthday", but did not comp one of the desserts.  Most restaurants would have comped us the dessert for the birthday girl.  I would come back to HOPR, but perhaps at a time when it is not so busy so as to avoid any wait.</review>

	<review>One of the best experiences I've ever had in my years of dining was here at House of Prime Rib. The food here is delicious and the portions are huge including a lot of tasty side dishes. The ambiance was very English pub-like; very fancy &amp; pleasant. I ordered the King Henry VIII Cut which was the biggest cut of prime rib they had. The prime rib was delicious...very juicy and tender. I'm usually a steak person, but man...this slice of prime rib was heaven (and if you finished it, they would give you a free but thinner slice on the house). It came with several sides which included a bowl of salad with their own very delicious house dressing. You had a choice between mashed potatoes or a baked potato and also a choice between creamed spinach or yorkshire pudding. I got the baked potato which was topped with some sour cream, chives and cheese which was really good, and the creamed spinach which wasn't bad either. The service here is great, our waitress was very charismatic and extremely nice and quick despite a very busy night that night. Will come here again.</review>

	<review>I am a HUGE beef eater, but I don't care for prime rib.  So, with that in mind, this restaurant is AWESOME!  I don't know if I was lucky or what, but our server was great, the food was delicious (and plentiful--I can't imagine how anyone could eat seconds), and our table was ready only a few minutes after our reservation time.  I think the service was so good, it jaded me a little.  I'm just so used to servers who don't care if you like you food or your drinks, or try to SERVE you in any way (especially at all these little bistros and restaurants that all you San Franciscoers seem to like so much).  Call me wierd, but I prefer reliably good food with servers who want you to be happy.</review>

	<review>House of Prime Rib is one of the best steak places I had tried.  I love their salad. They bring you bread to stuff you before you eat your steak... so try not to eat too much of that or else you will not be able to enjoy your steak.  This place is great for big groups, they will seat you in a private area. I love their setting and environment.  This place is expensive but it is worth it.</review>

	<review>Without a doubt the BEST prime rib I've ever had the last 15 or so times I've been there! I've eaten prime rib in the Midwest and it's not quite up to HOPR level. It's always consistently excellent. Service is always the best, the hand-crafted cocktails are the best, the prime rib is the best ... How can you go wrong? The premier beef in town, superb manhattans and a great staff!</review>

	<review>I am writing this delinquent review because Missy H. asked where she should go for dinner. The answer is obviously, The House of Prime Rib. It took me a long long time to make it here, and I regret every minute of those five years.  But really, "House of Prime Rib"?  It doesn't SOUND that appetizing.  It sounds like Waffle House, or International House of Pancakes.   Beatrice, I was a fool not to have believed in you. This place is truly awesome.  Old school, yes.  But absolutely delicious.  The staff is professional.  The hosts were very gracious to me and my party (we were grossly late).  There are incredible finds at good values on the wine list.  Their creamed spinach is delightfully bacon-y.  And their showmanship is top notch. Sure, it's showy to have carts wheel around standing rib roasts.  It's showy to dress the salad table-side, with enough creamy dressing for five salads.  It's showy to serve the Yorkshire puddings from the pan, beautifully browned with beef drippings.   Showy, but delicious.  Learn from my mistake, and go.  Even if you think you do not like prime rib... let the HOPR change your mind.  If they can't do it, then it can't be done.</review>

	<review>This place is, by far, my favorite restaurant.  If I had a request for my last meal before I died, it would be a HOPR house cut prime rib, medium rare, with the REAL horseradish (not the cream stuff), with creamed spinach, and a loaded baked potato.  Their salad is awesome.  The Yorkshire pudding is divine.  I've been here about 6 or 7 times since 2000, and the service has been great every time I've been here.  I do advise on making reservations in advance. Otherwise, you could be waiting a long time if you're a walk-in customer.  Not much to choose from other than what cut of prime rib you want, and maybe the fish of the day.  Also, don't try to look for parking on the street.  Spend the 7 or 8 bucks for valet parking.  You'll go nuts trying to find somewhere to park by yourself.   I've never been able to request a second helping of prime rib, but I'm glad to know that I can get it if I ever have room.  It is my goal in life to make it to that second helping. Go MEAT!</review>

	<review>Give me a big slab of medium rare meat, a healthy side of creamed spinach and a potato the size of Idaho and I am in Heaven. The House of Prime Rib is an institution, a feel good because you are about to go up about three inches around your waistline. We had a 6:00 reservation that due to Holiday traffic and the rain were late for. Not an issue as we were still warmly greeted and seated at a nice booth in the main dining room. Our waitperson made sure to to visit shortly after and took our drink orders. I started out with a vodka gimlet which was the perfect drink to get the night out with friends started. Soon after our drinks arrived our waitress came by to explain the in's and outs of the menu and how to order. She was super awesome and made us feel at home. The big choice is size do you want your cut of prime rib. I was hungry, but had a feeling that that if I went with with the "City Cut' (the petite cut) that would be more than enough. My assumption was correct as the slab was just about a half a cow. Served up with your choice of either creamed corn or creamed spinach and mashed potatoes or a baked potato. To top it off you you are offered Yorkshire pudding. Oh wait! Almost forgot, a salad and cornbread is also included with the price of admission. I am now up four inches on my waistline. The cornbread is all you can eat and careful because you won't stop because it really is that good. All in all an excellent dining experience and one that for sure will repeat soon.</review>

	<review>I heart HOPR!!!  I love the ambiance of this place.  The staff is wonderful and attentive.  They make sure your glass is never empty, whether it be just the water or the wine.  I really enjoy watching them make the salad fresh at your table.   We came here for a friend's surprise birthday and it reminded me of Benihana's where they take a free polaroid picture for you, it was funny.  She still has our group photo on her kitchen counter.   The next time my hubby and I are feeling carnivorous, we will definitely make the trek to SF!</review>

	<review>I am in no way a prime rib guy, but I will give credit when it is deserved the slab of meat I got from the house of prime rib was absolutely spectacular. After being seated at the table we are given menus and after viewing the menu I think to myself, why do they even have a menu? And if you're going to tell me that you can order stuff that's not prime rib then I will ask you why are you reading this review if you're not looking for a good hunk of cow?  Basically the menu is just to tell you the different sizes they have which is useless for me since I always go for the biggest steaks, this is America!!  Home of the fatties! Where's the beef?!  Well it's in that meat wagon we've heard so much about so I'll skip those details and go straight to the beef that's on my plate.  ABSOLUTE PERFECTION!  There was nothing else to I could think of after my first bite into the prime rib.  Everything Prime Rib should be was now sitting in front of me.  The au just a great complement to a wonderfully medium rare piece of meat.  The yorkshire pudding sittng on the side soaking up the tasty meat juices and au jus.  I was in a predicament, do I want to devour this thing as fast as possible because it was so tasty?  Or do I want to savor the awesomeness that sat in front of me...before I could decide what I wanted to do it was gone...meaning I finished it.   Boy was I stuffed!  And here comes my server, "would you like some more meat?"  I wanted to say yes, but I let my better judgement get the best of me that time and declined. Next time I may not be so wise! To put an end to the story, if you want a great meal at a great price I will easily recommend this place. Compared to prices at other "steakhouses," what you pay here is a bargain.  But this isn't a steakhouse, this is the House of Prime Rib, and yes it's as awesome as everybody says it is.  So stop reading and go here or at least make your reservation to go here.</review>

	<review>I was really disappointed. I go out for a steak dinner maybe once or twice a year. Usually Morton's or Peter Luger's (when I'm in NYC). This was my steak dinner for the year and it was pretty poor. I will say that the service was excellent. The waiter was very nice, incredibly attentive and extremely accommodating. The salad was terrific (especially considering it was crappy lettuce, canned beets and thousand island dressing). They even had a decent zinfandel by the glass (you need a heavy red to go with meat). Dinner comes with the aforementioned salad, the prime rib, creamed spinach, baked or mashed potato and yorkshire pudding.  I thought the spinach was pretty nasty, but if you like creamed spinach then I'm sure its up your alley. The baked potato with all the fixins was terrific. I've never had Yorkshire pudding before so I don't know if HOPR does it better than anyone else. It was fine, though. I ordered the big cut of meat because my girlfriend wasn't going to get her own and we were going to share. I ordered it rare and it came rare (too rare for her). The meat was fatty and pretty tasteless. My friend got it medium rare and he didn't like it any better. Just disappointing. I've got the bone with a lot of meat still on it. I'll see if my dogs like it better than I did. It is certainly cheaper than Mortons, since you can get a full dinner for $30. It costs more than that just for the steak at Morton's. Then you have to pay for the salad and any sides. I wouldn't go here just to save money on a fancy steak dinner. You are probably better off at Outback. You won't get the amazing service but at least you can get a bloomin onion.</review>

	<review>OK, so I'm a native San Franciscan but have never been to House of Prime Rib...so why not give it a try.  Actually, we received a gift certificate from dear friends of ours.  We made a reservation the day before and all they had available was 4:00...which was perfect. It's definitely old school...compared to all the trendy good restaurants in the city.  The menu is limited to prime rib or fish of the day.  But, if they're offering the highest USDA grade of beef, it would seem sacrilegious to order anything other than beef.  The meal came with bread (sour and corn bread), salad,  potato (mashed or baked), creamed spinach or creamed corn, and Yorkshire pudding.  The portions are generous, but is it really worth $40?  To be fair, the meal was deliciously good, the service pleasant, and the ambiance old school...it was worth trying once...but I could think of better places to spend my $40.00.  Oh, and we didn't drink...so our bill was less than it would have otherwise been. BTW, back to the 4:00 reservation. It may seem early to most (including us) for dinner, but it was perfect.  By the time we were done, the restaurant was starting to get crowded.  We were out by 5:30...plenty of time to walk around while there was still daylight...because we were definitely STUFFED.</review>

	<review>There's just nothing like this place.  Not in the city anyway.  I started coming here in my teens when my mom mistook it for Harris' and yelled at the HOPR hosts for not having our reservation.  Even though we were totally in the wrong, they seated us and were very nice.  (My mother was humiliated later when she realized her mistake.)  Thank god she made the flub, though, because we have since fallen in love with this place.  It is a great departure from all the trendy, upscale San Fran eateries.  It's frequented by out-of-towners and old SF types (for example, cops), and as a native, I love it for that.   Besides which, the meat is amazing, the salad is inexplicably delicious (I usually reject any non-vinaigrette dressing, but whatever's in that pink stuff is sublime).  DO NOT come here for variety.  If you're having one of those What-am-I-in-the-mood-for? nights, stay away.  Come to the House of Prime Rib to eat wonderfully prepared prime rib and enjoy great fixings.   Your $40 covers a loaf of sourdough bread and butter, that crazy delicious salad (huge), all-you-can-eat prime rib (provided that you don't go for the city cut), excellent horseradish (hot is REALLY spicy; don't assume you're man enough for it), yorkshire pudding (excellent), baked (with all the fixings) or mashed potato (with gravy and oh so creamy like grandma's), and creamed corn or spinach.  It is a feast.   In short, the experience is definitely a throwback, but despite--or because--of that, it has its share of charms.  AND IT IS MM MM GOOD.</review>

	<review>RUN! Don't walk to Harris' Restaurant up the block! We came to House of Prime Rib sober, very nicely dressed and wanting to have a nice evening with a celebration dinner. One of my friends ordered drinks with the bartender Jennifer and cracked a very nice joke.  She scowled.  My friend said, "I was just trying to butter you up." Her reply was that she "got the memo." She proceeded to falsely accuse my friend of having called her a bitch and had a fellow employee get the manager for her. The manager, in the grandest failure of customer service, was extremely patronizing and condescending.  To add insult to injury, he proceeded to talk "homey" - "You are staring me down." Because of the tremendous amount of business they do they have entitled themselves to piss-poor attitudes and customer service. As a born and bred San Franciscan I am ashamed that this represents to many people what fine dining might be in this great City.</review>

	<review>Place is solid. It's very good actually but I took a star off because the wait is always bad. Even when you make a reservation way in advance. The maitre'd is very conscientious and if the wait is too long, he'll come around and offer free drinks on the house. Just be nice and patient. The decor is nice and the experience is well worth it, and the prices are pretty decent -  the only thing is that of course they basically only serve prime rib. Being a heftier steak fan, lb for lb, I'll go down the street to Harris' for a meaty porterhouse that will do justice to a bottle of cab..</review>

	<review>I decided to treat myself and my boyfriend here in celebration for finding a job!  I made a reservation for 8:30 and arrived at 8:00, just in case they would be able to seat us early.  We sat down in the lounge to enjoy some cocktails why we waited.  I ordered a lemon drop martini, and OH MY!  Our waitress poured the first glass, and left the rest in the martini shaker for me to pour later.  Needless to say, I was warm and fuzzy before the meal started. We got seated right at our reservation time, and I soon found myself in food heaven!  Food just kept appearing out of no where.  My stomach that night seemed like a bottomless pit, welcoming every bit of it.  The meal started with a warm dinner roll and butter.  Next, the spinning salad, dressed table side, was fun to watch and delicious to eat.  The cornbread was the one part of the meal that I didn't truly care for.  The  fully loaded baked potato with butter, sour cream, chives, and bacon was...well what can i say...is something topped with butter, sour cream, chives and bacon anything less than amazing? And then finally the piece de la resistance: a medium House of Prime Rib cut served with yorkshire pudding, cream spinach and three different levels of horseradish sauces for your dipping pleasure.  The meat was cooked to perfection, carved table side, and dressed in a delectable au jus.  The spiciest of the the horseradish sauces was the one for me!  It was sensory overload.  Somehow at the end of the meal, we managed to split a creme brulee which was creamy and oh so delicious. At the end of the meal, I found myself 10 pounds heavier and so much happier.</review>

	<review>This is by far one of the best prime rib I have ever ate.  Their salad and bread are very good too! The setting inside is very nice.  The servers are great.  The only thing I don't like is that it gets crowded in there, so the place gets kind of loud sometimes.  Otherwise, it is a great place to bring your family and date there.</review>

	<review>These guys at HOPR have most definitely honed their craft into perfection. They deliver consistent quality of prime rib that just melts in your mouth. If you want prime rib... there's no question on where to go. The tasty full sized salad and generous extra sides that come with it seals the deal. Best deal for your meat fix! The decor is warm and classy and the service is very friendly. Just make sure you call for reservations. Otherwise, expect to wait over an hour to get seated.</review>

	<review>Where to begin.  let's see this was the culminating dinner of the weekend that we chose to celebrate my 30th birthday.   We made reservations on line a week in advance for 8pm.   We were running late up in Napa valley, and hurried back to the city so we could make our reservation time  Turns out we probably should of stayed and had dinner up there. We arrived and checked in at 7:50pm.  The host checked our name off and said we would be seated shortly and told us we could wait at the bar. After 20 minutes, I went back to check and assured we were next.  Well 40 minutes later, one of the other hostesses was walking through looking for another 3 person party that was waaay down the list that I saw, so we asked what about us, and after a 5 minute discussion with the host, came back and finally seated us. By now we were salivating and could see the carts come across.  Our waiter was very nice, and funny, but service was SLOOOOW.  The salad tasted like lettuce with big mac sauce on it. so not worth it.    One of my friends loved the English cut, which is why i'm rating this 2 stars instead of 1.  The other friend that came with us and I both ordered the House cut.  Some how his came  back twice as thick.  The spinach was ok, and the "worlds best mashed potatos" were mediocre at best.   Personally, I have had better prime rib in a buffet in Vegas. Maybe we came at a bad day or they were too busy, but i can tell you the last 2 times i went to Lawry's, it was 1000% times better then this place. I would so not recommend this place to anyone, atleast on a Saturday night.</review>

	<review>A few months ago we flew to San Francisco to visit some friends and celebrated my boyfriend's birthday at the House of Prime Rib.  I choose this place because it was featured on, "The best thing I ever ate" and my boyfriend's love for a good prime rib. We were all disappointed that our visit started off a little rough.  We weren't too happy that we had to wait over 30 minutes in the lounge for a reservation that we had made weeks beforehand.  Who knows how long they would have kept us waiting if we hadn't gone up and said something.  But once we were seated that's when our waiter laid on his charm. Honestly we wish we would have remembered our waiter's name because he deserves to be acknowledged for his excellent service.  He mixed in plenty of good lines while helping us with our orders. By the end of the night we felt like he was apart of our group of friends. As for the food itself, it was really good.  The big servings and tender cuts of meat are what we love most about prime rib!  What shocked us about the House of Prime Rib is that you can get free seconds!  We couldn't believe it.   Overall we thought the meat tasted great and our waiter treated us unbelievably well. Overall, a great experience!   But because we had to wait 30 minute for our table we had to knock off a star. We were ready to hand them a 5 star.</review>

	<review>I LOVE THIS RESTAURANT! I came here with a friend and boy did i leave stuffed and happy! It's definitely a place where reservations need to be made in advance. Parking wasn't too difficult, there's a little parking structure to the right. ($2 dollars i believe?). Everything was amazing! Decor, atmosphere, service and most importantly the food! Our dinner started off with salad (delicious!) that they mix in front of you, so cool! (I would ask for light on the salad dressing next time though).We both ordered the The English Cut (thinly sliced into three pieces)! Our dish came with mash potatoes, corn bread and creamed corn. Everything was so good, the portions are huge so you totally get your moneys worth! I can't wait to go backkkk!</review>

	<review>What? How is it possible that I have not reviewed this SF institution? Over the past few years I've been to HOPR a handful of times. It is definitely a special occasion place not for the price but for the sinful offerings. The service is always impeccable--whether we are a large party of 10 or an intimate table for 2.. The wine list is excellent...but let's face it..the highlight is always the meat. Always perfectly seasoned and prepared--and just when you think you can't eat anymore--the server comes by and ask you whether you would like another courtesy serving.. (dreamy) The Yorkshire pudding is pure deliciousness-and the perfect complement to the Prime Rib. I heart HOPR!</review>

	<review>Beef, glorious beef.  Actually I could live without the beef almost, I love the sides.  The baked potato is huge and awesome.  Sure I can do baked potato at home, but I feel so guilty putting all that butter and sour cream.  Here's it's not my fault, someone else is to blame;)  And the creamed spinach is so good with all the bacon in it.  The beef is good.  Not the best I've had, I like a crust on the outside which this doesn't have, but it's good.  The horseradish comes in mild, almost mild and sinus clearing, tear-inducing hot.  I mixed the hot and medium to get the right singe on in the nostrils. Service was good.  I like the table-side presentation of the salad and the baked potato.  Normally I think that kind of thing is corny, but at an old school place like this you gotta have it.  It makes me feel like it's 1979 all over again.  Good times.</review>

	<review>You might think that I am crazy to claim that a $40 dinner here is a steal. Although I am crazy, $40 ain't shit compared to other steakhouses in the area like Harris or Ruth's Chris. Although the wait here is a bitch even with reservations, the food, service, and atmosphere is worth it all. The place has a classy, old-school San Fran feel with the art and table-scape. The service is fantastic and always on point.   The menu has very limited choices (just options for size of cuts) due to the set menu but you can get fish.  I am a big fan of specialization so I would even take a step further and get rid of the fish; the place is called House of Prime Rib, not Sea of Nemos. I go for the King Henry, the King cut, since you can get a thin slice for seconds. Comes with a large plate of one of the best salads ever, cream spinach, yorkshire pudding, and choice of potato. Steak is fabulous in the au jus, use the yorkshire to soak it up. Just a fantastic all-around restaurant for any occasion.</review>

	<review>Overrated.  I recognize that the prime rib is very good.  There's also a sort of mafia-istic charm to the whole place.  But I've had better for cheaper.  Still, its a San Francisco institution that everyone should go to exactly once.</review>

	<review>I went to House of Prime Rib for my birthday and it was a great experience. The menu was simple, which is always my preference. The meat was very tender and was probably one of the best I've ever had. Even the creamy spinach was super good, even though it looked strange at first. The service was superb, and I loved the atmosphere with a lot of laughs and smiles. I would definitely go back.</review>

	<review>The BEST BEST BEST prime rib you can ever taste. You've never tasted REAL prime rib until now! The meal is served with: 1) Salad (The waiter tosses the salad in a big bowl in front of you. Although the presentation is unique... don't really eat the salad. It's not worth your stomach space) 2) Loaf of bread on a wooden cutting board (Also don't eat. Bread = carbs) 3) PRIME RIB with Augu sauce sliced right in front of you from a big dome looking cart which carries big prime rib. (Am I spelling Augu right? Anyways... the BEST part. Savor every bite) 4) Bread pudding (Although this is carbs... very worth to eat. VERY good) 5) Potatoes (I like mashed the best... but the baked is also good) 6) Cream spinach (You will want to ask for seconds!) ***Note to readers: Yes,... House of Prime Rib is considered a tourist spot and I can vouch that most San Francisco guide books will gear out-of-towners to dine here. But the truth is... it's listed on the guide for a reason. The food is amazing. I've had prime rib in NY and it doesn't even compare to HOPR***</review>

	<review>This place is totally kick ass.  It's meant for the old school beefeaters mind you, not for the faint of heart, because they will carve up your cut of choice for you right at your table from the giant beef zeppelin that they maneuver around the floor, and then bring it slowly towards you when it's your turn to get a slice.  And they even serve it with that popover type thingy that you can soak up the gravy with, what is that called?  Some kind of a pudding or pie, that's not really a pie at all.. Yorkshire pudding, that's it.... oh yeah, they even toss your salad right at your table too.  The cocktails are, well they are real cocktails, order a Manhattan and watch out for the size of that thing!  It comes in an individual mixer that they will leave with you to pour out the leftovers.  So yes I really love this spot for so many reasons, but one that I remember most of all is when I I took my dear departed friend Tedd here for his birthday one year, we managed to spill some red wine all over the place, and the waiter said don't worry about it darlin', here's a fresh one for you, on the house.   Do it.</review>

	<review>This place must be so gross to a vegetarian, meat and more meat!! But, though not a big meat eater, I'm not a vegetarian. I have been here 3 times, the last time being last Saturday. It's a good place for special occasions, especially if you have some meat and potato types on your hands. I normally try to hide the taste of meat with something (sauce, rub, marinade, etc.) but the meat here doesn't need any hiding. The prime rib is full of flavor...a little horse radish and you're all set. The best part of the evening was our GREAT waitress Sara which made the night even more special.</review>

	<review>Get the house of prime rib cut which is juicy and marbles more even. Most of all you can get a second piece.  I got the King Henry VIII cut which was a good chunk of meat a bit too much and not as good a piece of meat as the House of Prime Rib cut.  The sides are ok...not great the baked potato, the salad and the yorkshire pudding are your better choices.  We walked in last minute and was given a awful table right on the side of the room door. My chair got hit 50 times throughout my dinner. Oh well our server was pleasant and the creme bruele was passable.  Please note that the 2nd piece is not good for taking home so if you can't eat it don't ask for it.</review>

	<review>Being one of the biggest fans of prime rib, Id have to say that the "House of Prime Rib" lives up to its name. I have never had such a delicious prime rib in awhile. (Being my first visit). The meat was tender and perfectly cooked. I ordered my meat rare, like I always do, most restaurant meats that are ordered rare come with a big piece of fat in the middle, but not this place. The best part of my plate was to see the extra juices that created a puddle underneath the meat. I swear I was in heaven when I took the first bite. The cream spinach was excellent; the salad was an aquired taste that took a little while for me to adjust to. ( I would go with Ceasar!). The only negative for that night was the waitress who took a little while to take care of refills and check-ups. She looked very fatigued and sleepy. I would give your waitering staff a break! Customer service is key! The scenery was elegante, along with the wine displays I was excited to be in such a high class restaurant. I loved the bar area and the prime rib carts being pushed around by the handlers. This will be a definite frequent stop to make for any visitor or local to come and enjoy. My compliments to the owner, managers, and employees of the House of Prime Rib.</review>

	<review>You have to be a serious meat eater to eat here. Without reservations, we waited about 1.5 hours but enjoyed the free chex mix while we waited. The overall restaurant is loud due to the sheer number of people dining, but it may have also been the acoustics of the place. The back room is significantly quieter. The recommeded strategy when eating here is to not fill yourself with the salad, breads, and potatoes. It is tempting to but it will ruin your appetite for the prime rib.  If you do succumb to the temptations, you won't be disappointed. The salad and the Yorkshire pudding is delicious.</review>

	<review>This is by far my favorite prime rib place.  You definately get a great value for ALL the food they give you.  The salad &amp; baked potato is delicious.  By the time I get my prime rib I'm stuffed, but thankfully it still taste good when I have it for lunch the next day.  If you do finish your prime rib, they even give you seconds if you request it. Downside:  the snooty host behind podium and the long wait even though you have reservations.   Here's a tip, be extra nice to the host or you will never get a seat.  Everyone else there is pretty nice.</review>

	<review>Everything about this place is good.  I love prime rib and this place is my favorite for it.  Make sure you are hungry when you go because everything that comes with the meal is good.  It comes with salad that is sprinkled with their signature seasoning and bread pudding.  Make sure you dip your bread in the au jus : )   The prime rib is cooked perfectly.  You have different cuts to choose from.  I like the thinly sliced one since it is able to soak up more of the juices.  You can get seconds and thirds.  I also recommend getting the creamed spinach as a side. The only negative thing I can think of is that you usually have to make reservations way in advance or you'll have to eat really late or really early if you call the day of.</review>

	<review>Came here again for my brother's birthday. We had reservations and we didn't have to wait more than 15 mins! Now that's a first! Maybe they are reading these things on yelp....=) Anyways, we were seated at a nice corner booth. Our server was fantastic and was joking around with us all night long. We had the usual expected good meal of bread, salad, PRIME RIB, yorkshire pudding, and potato. We all got a second helping and could barely move afterwards. Always a treat to come here, but they really need to do something about the wait times!</review>

	<review>Our waiter, John, was awesome. He reminded me of the 80s. I think it was his hair and big smile and general attitude. I had two dirty vodka martinis,  so I felt like everything was pretty awesome. It was my friend's bday and the entire staff sang while giving him raspberry ice cream. Then they had all 11 of us pose in front of the fireplace and (while we stood there posing and grinning and joking for five minutes) ran around like nuts looking for the polaroid camera. We eventually got two photos. The steak was devoured. I had some fish special. The cornbread comes out shaped like ... well. You should probably just go there and find out for yourself. Prepare to spend some $$$. All that attention is not cheap.</review>

	<review>I haven't been back here for years.  Well, fate and my friend's birthday had dragged me into the antiquated doors of the HOPR.  As expected, by the time our entire party arrived, we had to wait in the lounge for our table as we got pushed back.  I ordered a rum and coke from the bar while we were waiting(warning!, the drink is $10!).   After we got seated, most of us knew the drill.  I got the King Henry as it was the best deal for the money.  Only about $5 more than the smallest cut($40 instead of $35).  The salad came first and the always lovely presentation of mixing and spinning.  I did notice that I got a ton of sliced beets and cilantro in my plate.  Not a problem for me but can be for those of you who are not fans of either in salad.  The bread was warm and hot but I recommend no more than one piece because one will regret the second piece of bread later on in the meal! Finally the meat arrived and as expected, I got the bone with my medium rare meat.  It really was a thick cut and beneath was the appetizing au jus gravy that the meat is slowly absorbing alongside the mashed potatoes.  My meat was more on the rare side and was chewier than usual but I didn't mind rare cooked meat. The meat was juicy and tender.  My creamed corn was also a nice change from the creamed spinach that I had last time.   I ended up barely finishing my steak and declining to get the second plate.  The second plate usually is just a thin slice with mostly gravy on there but it is available for anyone who wants another piece. Then the dessert menu came and honestly, who will order dessert at this place?  I may never know how good their desserts are because of their awesome steaks! Then the bill came and I knew the steak's price but not the drink from the bar!  Sticker shock ensued and after a moment of madness, I calmed down and decided that I needed to behave on my friend's birthday and graciously, I paid my portion of the meal. Would I come back for more steak?  Yes no doubt about it.  Would I ever get a bar drink?  No No No No.  Final notes: Valet is $8 but there is a self pay parking lot down the street from the restaurant.</review>

	<review>THE BEST!  Have been going there for many many years....since a child.  The food has remained consistent....actually better than ever. The Prime Rib is prepared like no other....the accompaniments, such as their famous salad, creamed spinach, potatoes, and the Yorkshire Pudding are delicious.  You will be stuffed, but if you have room...they will give you seconds for free...if you ask!  They have a full bar...and wonderful bartenders - drinks are very generous. This is our favorite restaurant!!  I highly recommend it.</review>

	<review>HOPR is one of the rare establishments in San Francisco that has consistently lived up to its name for many, many years.  I've been here twice.  The menu is ingeniously simple.  Just choose your desired size and cut of meat and side dish (the mashed potatoes and creamed spinach are both delicious!).  Your meal begins with a surprisingly delicious salad that your server makes delicately in front of your table.  Awesomeness! Then comes the slab of prime rib; also very delicious if you love a good piece of meat.  The service: impeccable.  A little secret: you're able to order seconds with sides for free (that's right: FREE) if you still have room for more food in your stomach.  You are guaranteed to leave this place full! Locals and tourists alike must visit this place if you don't mind splurging a bit!</review>

	<review>I usually do not like prime rib much, but here, I ended up devouring every bite! Everything was so tender and juicy, I was in heaven! drinks were a little pricey and the sides were mediocre. However, their dessert was to die for! I forgot what it was called, but I ordered a triple layered cake. cheesecake, chocolate mousse, and something else, i forget. but OMG it was the best dessert i've ever had in my life!!! Overall, it was a great experience and a nice restaurant for special occasions, but it is a little overrated. We still had to wait 20+ minutes even though we made reservations in advance. Still, can't wait to go back just for the dessert alone.</review>

	<review>This place is extremely similar to Lawry's in southern California but not as great.  I tried to make reservations over the phone and the man over the phone just would not cooperate.  I had to call back another day to get someone else to help me.  The food is comparable to Lawry's from the salad to the prime rib to the Yorkshire pudding.  I find a hard time distinguishing between this place and Lawry's in terms of quality of meat.  This place lets you get seconds on your order if you finish your first plate which is nice if you're aiming to be super bloated and full.  The crme brle was amazingly delicious, must try! If I must choose, Lawry's over House of Prime Rib... Pros:  Good meat and great dessert selection Cons:  No parking but where in SF has any?</review>

	<review>Wish I could give half-stars as I would only give 1/2 a star off for the curt waitress. I travel alone for business but like to enjoy the finer places so I just go alone and try to give a bit bigger tip to compensate the server for waiting on a one top, but the server this particular night seemed to feel my presence was an obstacle to providing better service to bigger parties and bigger drinkers. I waited for my table at the bar and the bartender made a superb Bombay Sapphire martini on par with the best I've had.  I wish I could remember the gentleman's name, but if you watch Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations he made an appearance during Tony's visit to HOPR. I have to say my experience otherwise has yet to be matched by any other fine steakhouse anywhere.  I ordered the Henry XIII cut and it was the most fantastic roast beef I've ever had, and the two-three ounce complimentary seconds joyfully prolonged the ecstatic eating adventure.  Never been to Lawry's but I was fascinated by the stainless steel "Zeppelin" that contained the slab from which the prime rib portions were cut.  This was a very nice touch, as was a personal introduction to the carver who tended the Zeppelin. Included in the very reasonable price of around $40 (not including drinks and tip) was a hand tossed beet salad, which I later discovered uses Lawry's vintage salad dressing.  Backing up the meal was a baked potato which the server cut and prepared with butter, sour cream, bacon, and chives, fluffy and delicious Yorkshire pudding to soak up the juices from the prime rib, and creamed spinach which was very good. While my next visit to San Francisco will probably take me to the Tadich Grill, if I have time I will definitely make a return visit to HOPR.</review>

	<review>this was the choice of one of my friend's for our sunday night dinner group.  i enjoyed my english cut, the baked potato w/all the fixings was amazing, creamed corn was stellar, yorkshire pudding is a tasty popover in a different shape.  the salad was nice, but not as yummy as i remembered -- too much dressing.  please pass on the creamed spinach.  we shared the chocolate fantasy; the name alone says it all.  we shared a very tasty bottle of pinot noir, of which i forget the name.  i wish i remembered the name of our server.  she was quite pleasant and made the dinner all the better.   start the night off w/a martini at the bar!  i asked for the lemon drop  sub fresh lemon juice, minus the sweet and sour, and it was made to perfection!</review>

	<review>Ok.  First, let me give my disclaimer - When I went here a few years ago, I was not eating red meat.  I went with a couple of BIG meat eaters, however. First we waited in the cocktail "lounge" which was filled with odd square furniture. When we were seated, the "Meat Zeppelins" were wheeled around... it looked highly unsanitary to me.  As I wasn't partaking, I asked the waiter for a recommendation, and he recommended the salmon.  The salmon flat out stunk.  Bad bad bad. And the salad was worse, if that is possible... It looked like it had been made from the compost heap.   I did pick at the food and ate a few bites, which I regretted later on as I developed a stomachache ...  Not a bargain, at any price.</review>

	<review>i eat my steaks seared and rare. i understand the cuts here are from a roast, but of the six of us, none of our steaks were hot. the portions are big - too big. we discovered a surcharge on our check for $7.50 because myself and my friend shared a steak. we were not told that we would be charged for this convenience and only discovered this affront when the six of us were doing the ' tab-splitting' math. the final insult: a very ungenerous pour for my after dinner cognac. if rated on food alone, i might have given 3 stars, but the somewhat steep pricing - considering the quality of the meal and the poor service - nixes that.</review>

	<review>I LOVE eating here!!! This place is SO much fun! The food is awesome! The prime rib is perfect. The salad is tasty. The creamed spinach and yorkshire pudding are my favorites. Decent wine list...nothing to write home about, but you can get a decent bottle of A.Rafanelli and be happy.  Don't think I had a cocktail, but the bartender was friendly. Service is on point, and really flawless. I've had several GREAT nights at this restaurant. Some of the best prime rib in the bay. Highly recommend it!</review>

	<review>Yum!!! Best prime rib house in the city!   The wait can be a little long here as it seems quite popular.  We waited for about 30 minutes.  You could get drinks and hangout in the lounge area. I tried the english cut and it was more than enough as I couldn't finish the baked potatoes and had zero room for desserts.   Next time, I'll bring a bigger appetite! Need to loosen my belt on the way out! Service was quick and excellent too.</review>

	<review>I've been here a few times and have always been satisfied.  This is a place that will absolutely fill you up.  The name sake, Prime Rib is quite yummy.  I especially like that they have the meat carts come to your table. You can get seconds if you like but for the most part, it's pretty difficult to have a second serving of meat. Regarding their salad, the dressing really makes it something special. Great place to have dinner and a fun time!  MUST make reservations though. They also have valet parking.</review>

I'm so going to grow old and have a husband that insists on coming here every time we go out (which won't be that often) because he loves beef and doesn't give two hoots about ambiance or variety or the fact that our old arteries can't handle that kinda clogging. ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh! zhhhooppp.  Ok, back to reality.  Our girl Wendy brought a couple of us HOPR virgins here last night.  Couldn't believe I had never been, how many years have I been in this city?  Oh yeah, ALL of them.   And really aside from the waking nightmare, this place wasn't all that bad.  The prime rib is pretty good. And the service is awesome.  We were seated promptly.  Everything - the salad, the beef, the potatoes are prepped and served up right beside your table.  And our server was amazingly nice. Your only choices on the menu are large slice, larger slice, larger but thinner slice, and really large slice.  But it is House of Prime Rib, not House of Lots of Things in Addition To Prime Rib.  (I credit Wendy with that punchline).  And along with the beef, you get a tasty salad (which contains MSG and paprika in the special crack powder that they sprinkle on the salad, and oh yeah thousand island dressing!  So classy, but my Asian self LOVED it.  You asians know what I'm talking about, and I digress), mashed or baked potato, creamed spinach or corn, and yorkshire pudding.  It's a lot of food.  Not necessary by any means.   I guess the only thing that was a little lacking was the ambiance.  I thought I was in Reno.   Oh and the martinis weren't up to steak house snuff. But all in all, I'm glad I went.  I probs won't be back for a while, but you gotta try everything once.</review>

	<review>I went to HOPR about a month ago and it was okai. When i first got there, the scenery and bar were decked out and pretty nice. I actually went there for a birthday party with about 20 heads. The first thing i noticed was the spacing of the tables. All the tables were very close to each other leaving barely any room for the surrounding tables and their patrons. Another thing i noticed the service. It was great that we got to meet the chef in person and how he was going to take care of us. But for the waiters and waitresses, they were jerks. They gave us attitude right from the beginning. When taking our orders, they kinda rushed us to pick something (even though their menu was  2 pages in size 30 font and only 4 things to eat). When even raising our hands for a refill on water or a clean fork, they acknowledge us raising out hands yet hesitated on helping us. I understand that they were busy with other tables and what not, but don't look twice at me and not do anything! I mean come on, the waiter looked at me twice with my hand up and did nothing. I had to get up actually talk to him and other waiters as well. Overall it was a fair experience with the $35 and up meals. I am a student and i don't think i would recommended any student to go here. I mean it would be an experience to remember but everyone is different and has different opinions on HOPR.</review>

	<review>I absolutely ADORE this place! I came here with my boyfriend's family (It is their favorite restaurant in the city) last Friday night. I have heard so much hype and great reviews about this place, and I must say, everything was even better than I had imagined! From the mafia-like ambiance, the 5 star kettle one dirty martini that comes with a shaker filled with extra (for when you want to refill it), the big round tables, the friendly and knowledgeable wait staff, the efficient, accurate, and lovely service, the old-fashioned feeling of the place, the COMPLETELY reasonable prices (Around 40-50 a plate- which comes with huge portions and amazing, delicious sides- which you would need to order separately at most other steakhouses), oh man... I could go on and on. My time here was amazing and it is definitely a new favorite:) I cannot wait to go back! You must try House of Prime Rib!!!! It is a MUST. (Unless you are a vegetarian... which I'm pretty sure is a given being that it is a STEAKHOUSE!)</review>

	<review>We came in here for dinner and quickly realized that they only had prime rib on the menu, so I would say they are confident it is pretty good. The salad was made tableside and it was very very good. The prime rib here was off the hook and I really enjoyed it. The creamed corn was also super delicious. This place can get real crowded and be a bit tough on the wallet so save it for special occasions, but definitely check it out if you're a steak lover.</review>

	<review>House of PR was a fun experience, but I don't think I'd go out of my way to come back. I had the House of PR cut. Let's just say the prime rib was very tender and juicy but not a whole lot of flavor. I've always had my prime rib seasoned and seared, so not what I was expecting and to my usual liking. However, service was great and everything came out in perfect timing. Seating arrangements may be a tad too tight and not enough comfortable breathing space. The setting was classy and sophisticated.</review>

	<review>This is one of the Best Little Secrets of San Francisco - They have been here for a long time.  But you will never leave unhappy.  They do a really good job on the Prime Rib.  They have a great wine selection and people are nice.  However the decor is a little old fashion.  The meal is very satisfying.  Be ready to make reservations at least month is advance.  And use of valet is the way to go!  Parking is very hard on Friday nights in this area.</review>

	<review>Very good food. Everything is super expensive but the cow is simply to die for. I'd go so far as to say its better than Alexander's in San Jose in terms of ambiance and friendliness of the host. The food is amazingly good, especially the Yorkshire pudding and the creamed spinach (hella good!!). The juicy steak is practically unlimited (what kind of a steak lover doesn't like that?) This place has a very good wine selection too, this is the kind of place you'd bring rich business execs (too bad you can't smoke a cigar in here  the ambiance is perfect for it).</review>

	<review>I love the House of Prime Rib!  It is definitely a treat for us, since we don't get to eat here often.   The first time I ate there, I had the English cut and was not completely satisfied.  This last time, I got the House cut, and boy, I was not disappointed!  I also went for the second slice.  I couldn't finish it though :(  And they wouldn't let me box it up.  They did, however box up the bone so I could feed it to my dog.   The salad is very yummy, but try not to over indulge!  Your stomach will appreciate you for not filling it up with Salad, since a delicious steak will be placed right in front of you very shortly. I could care less for the creamed corn, but maybe it was just my appetite for that night!  I wanted meat! If you like, order the sides half and half. (1/2 creamed corn, the other 1/2 creamed spinach)</review>

	<review>I am a huge fan of steak, but instead of paying restaurants $30-$50 for a good cut of meat I typically just buy a nice slab prep it and bbq it myself. Now for prime rib, it is a different story. The cooking involved, the seasoning and aging is so complex it is not something I would like to try when House of Prime Rib already has the art perfected for me at a reasonable price. And its not A la Carte. It comes with creamed spinach, mashed or baked potatos, yorkshire pudding, oh yeah and a healthy salad to start. Come here for a special occasion, the service is top notch, or just come here because you cant get enough of how good the meat is . Second to none. If you look at my reviews, there aren't any steakhouses, anyone can master grilling a nice piece of steak, but when it comes to prime rib, leave it to the professionals at the House of Prime Rib!</review>

	<review>This was my second visit to HOPR, and I will say that I think this time was better than my first.  I did not think it was possible, but our server/waiter RICK made our experience extremely enjoyable.  He was funny and attentive, and in his rushing around to take care of everyone, he found a few minutes to chat with us.  Plus, his service was TOP NOTCH!   If you have never been to HOPR, you definitely need to check it out.  For one price, you receive your particular cut of prime rib, plus potato, bread, spinach or corn, salad, and Yorkshire pudding.  Prices range from $30-$35 for your food depending on the cut of meat you would like.   The carving of prime rib is carved tableside, the salad is made and tossed tableside, and your baked potato comes with a tray of "fixin's".  There is actually more food that most people could possible eat.  And it is all delicious!  If you are looking for great food, generous portions, stellar service, and a unique old English feel, this is definitely the place to come.</review>

	<review>This place COULD be better. I made reservations at 9:30. I was not seated until 10. What's the point of making a reservation if you can't even be seated at the desired time? This is not the first time I have had this problem here either. After finally being seated, The food was good up until I got my primb rib. I asked for medium and it was obviously over cooked. It was very dry and chewy and I had to ask for more au jus in order to down the dry piece of meat. It was a disappointment. The primb rib here is not cooked consistanly well. I would have to say the best part of the meal was the salad. I don't think I will be coming back for a long time if not at ALL,</review>

	<review>I tool my bf here for his birthday because I know he loves red meat and even though I'm not much of a fan I had heard good things about this place. It has old school charm. We got there early and had a drink in the lounge. We were so hungry and were pleased to find that they had some complementary munchies for us. We were seated a couple minutes later and were greeted by our upbeat waiter. The place is sort of decked out like a medieval English castle or something and it felt slightly like a beef lovers theme park. All prime rib meals come with salad, creamed spinach/corn, Yorkshire pudding, and a mashed or baked potato. Hefty portions. It was definitely satisfying. I enjoyed it even though I am not a red meat lover. That's saying a lot. Oh yeah, be careful with the hot horseradish! It's good, but don't go overboard. I had major eyewatering going on from one bite.</review>

	<review>the food was ok, the experience was terrible! everyone raved about this place, so I was very eager to give this place a try.  the wait is about 30 minutes for a group of 10 even with a reservation.  DO NOT BRING YOUR OWN CAKE for any occasion unless you're ready to pay them to serve your cake.  I just got married a month ago and the last place I remember paying for someone to serve my cake was at my wedding.  But that's standard.   I was upset we were lead to a table 20 minutes after we'd had a reservation and THEN it was actually a joke, the table wasn't ready.  oooops, your bad.  more waiting for us.... YEY! then when we sat down - I asked for the manager and told the hostest to tell the manager I wanted to be discreet about coming over because I wanted to ask if they could waive the outrageous cake cutting fee for wasting 30 minutes of my time.  The hostess sent over this OLD man (who must have been 100 yrs old).  He shouted "WHO IS THE LADY WHO WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT THE CAKE?"  dude, old man, you've had at least 100 birthdays, have you ever had a surprise cake??  Needless to say, he ruined the surprise cake for our birthday boy.  I said, I asked the hostess to tell you to be discreet when you come over, the old fart couldn't hear me, so he said "WHAT!?" I said, "discreet"  then he said, "WHAT?!" I said, "DISCREET!" he was still confused, I said, "A SECRET!  IT WAS A SECRET!"  The result of that conversation, he said no, because we changed our party from 11 to 10?!?!?! They must have tables that come in different sizes for parties of 10 and 11.  Uhmm... yes, its totally our fault for having 1 less person. Dear HOUSE OF PRIME RIB, please order a hearing aid for your manager.  He can't hear his customers.   needless to say, i was frustrated with their attitude, but I wanted to give the food a chance.  i guess they were mad at me for asking that cake question, so I got served the toughest cut of HOPR.  oh well, the baked potato though, IS OFF THE HOOK.  I tried my gf's HOPR and it was delicious!  So, if you get an awesome cut, great.  If you're me, I guess you get extra left overs for your steak and eggs for the next morning.  Sorry for venting, and thanks for listening.</review>

	<review>Oh, my fellow yelpers, how could you let me down and steal money out of my wallet! Should have heeded the reviews that said the place was living on it's laurels. Had resi's for 7:30 Thursday night and was seated at 8pm (would have been seated right on time but I waited for a booth in the front). Place was jam packed as usual. Very high energy scene. Both DH and I ordered the House of Prime Rib cut medium rare/rare. First came mini loaf of sourdough which was OK. Next was house salad (which you get a ton of)but it was nothing special. Very watery as a matter of fact. We ordered baked potatoes (also gigantic) and creamed spinach as our sides. Prime rib was cooked correctly but had a mealy texture. Creamed spinach had an off flavor like it was over smoked (tasted kind of like the fake bacon bits) and was inedible. I adore yorkshire pudding but was underwhelmed by their version. Potato was fine. DH even refused "extra" portion. It really just wasn't that good. Service on the other hand was excellent. Even as busy as it was, he was very attentive and nice. At $38.45 per meal save your money for some GOOD food. Have had much better prime rib at other joints and they don't "carve" right at your table as advertised. Took us many years to come here and sadly we will not be back. C'est la vie!</review>

	<review>Holy mi goodness!!!! Seriously!! This place is fanatbulous. The portions are huge.  I took my boyfriend at the time here for his birthday in October. That was our first time and boy was I impressed. I was sold right after I took a bite of the salad. The salad actually made us fool and so by the time we got our prime rib, we were stuffed and had to take the rest home (It's OK though because I got to enjoy the rest of my prime rib the next day). I ordered the city cut which was basically the smallest cut of prime rib on the menu. My boyfriend on the other hand ordered the King Henry cut.  That thing scared me when I saw it. It was super big.  The best thing about the prime rib was that it was soooo tender and juicy and of course big. YUM-MO!!  The Yorkshire pudding was pretty good too. I also had creamed spinach, but I have to tell you, I wasn't a big fan of that. I absolutely love spinach, but the creamed spinach had a funny taste to it.   Just don't forget to call in your reservations at least a month in advance seriously!   I'd add a sixth star if I could for having vallet parking. It's so convenient being that this is in the city.  You know how parking gets there.   All in all, it's a great intimate place for couples.  Maybe not so much for children.</review>

	<review>This place has the best prime rib I've ever tasted -juicy, cooked perfectly, and perfect of amount of au jus on top.  I always get the English cut and ask for seconds!! Their sides are great as well! You always get a hearty plate full of food and will always walk away satisfied.  I really like how all the servers are friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable about the menu items and the restaurant.  I highly recommend this place to anyone who is a meat eater and is new to the bay area.  Once you try it - you're definitely hooked!!</review>

	<review>I am a meat and potatoes woman and this place fulfills my wants for both.   The food and service was great.  I love prime rib and the Yorkshire pudding...silly me, I thought it was going to be an actual pudding.  The best part is you can get seconds, for just a couple of bucks more they'll give you another (smaller) cut of prime rib.  No doggy bags though. Smiles from everyone.  Our server was always around when we needed her.  I didn't feel that she stepped beyond the boundaries and into our comfort zones. :) Hold on phone's ringing....HOPR.</review>

	<review>The King Henry VIII is, in the words of 2Pac, number one with a bullet. The prime rib is tender and succulent, the salad and their secret miracle salad dressing is fresh and delicious, the Yorkshire pudding is crispy on the edges and soft-but-not-soggy in the middle, and the spinach (while a wee bit salty) is still savory and oh so good. The staff is very attentive and will do everything they can to accommodate you. Usually I go for a family birthday, and they will take a picture of you and put it in a little folding keepsake frame to take home. The restaurant has very English gentleman's club decor, but it pulls this off without being unbearably pretentious. What can I say? The staff is helpful, the atmosphere is classic, and, if the prime rib's good enough for the 49ers, then it damn well is good enough for me!</review>

	<review>I'm in the minority here. I think this place is overrated.   Place has the atmosphere of a TGIF.   Loud, lively and fun.. The prime rib is ok but the portions are so small compare to other steakhouses.   I ordered the largest cut and it was maybe 16oz with 1/4 of it being fat.   And yes, I was offered an extra slice but even that was maybe 4oz.    If it wasn't for the Martini's, I would probably give HOPR a lower mark.    This place is more a novelty restaurant kinda like the "Big Texan" in Amarillo.    I may be a bit biased since Argentina ruined most of my love for US steak...</review>

	<review>Decided to try this place after hearing numerous raving reviews about this place for the past 5 years or so. I did remember to make a reservation, but only made it 24 hours in advance; hence only had a choice of 5, 5:30 pm, or after 8:30 pm...bummer Upon my arrival, I did hear the hostess inform the walk-in diners that the wait would be 2-2.5 hrs...good thing I made the reservation. I'll admit that I did have pretty high expectations for this place and I am comparing it to the rather classy Alexander's steakhouse down in Cupertino. The restaurant was old, but seemed to have been recently remodeled, maybe 5 years ago? Parking is either on the street, or $8 via Valet parking. The menu is pretty simple, small, medium, or large piece of Prime Rib, or fish? wtf? fish? ...didn't see anyone order that one... Every meal comes w/ a salad tossed in a dressing table side by your wait staff... Our waitress was definitely overwhelmed and wasn't able to maintain her composure due to the stress. The salad was okay, greens weren't super fresh and dressing was on the heavy side in my opinion. Prime Rib: I opted for the smallest slice and requested to have the bone. The waitress immediately tried to upsell me into the larger cut. Even though I declined the upsell, she still offered me the bone...good job! :) The prime rib is where the money is at. Super flavorful, well cooked, and yes, as some other Yelpers have said, can be eaten w/o a knife! ...very plump and tender! :D The mashed potatoes, creamed spinach and creamed corn were all...creamy...too creamy for my tastes... The yorkshire pudding, is um a plain crepe...no taste, very bland. Overall, service was mediocre. Ambience mediocre. Sides and salad were also mediocre. Prime Rib was 5 stars; hence the 4 star rating.</review>

	<review>It was my anniversary and we decided to try this place for the first time. The service was prompt and the food was delicious. I had the English Cut and it melted in my mouth. The hubby had the biggest cut and he didn't enjoy it as much. He preferred the cut I had but overall he thought it was a nice place to have dinner.</review>

	<review>Not as good as Lawry's Prime Rib, but this place is great for group dining that won't break the bank.  Service is friendly and informal.  They even provide you a complimentary photo of your whole party to each guests.  It's old school, but old school is what one desires at times.</review>

	<review>Duy, Duy, Duy,............our server. If only you knew who we were. How dare you come up to us while giving us a second slice of beef that you said to us..........."are you sure you are going to eat it???" my boss will not like this if you guys do not eat it." Even if we didn't eat it.............you, as a server, should know that customers are always right. Did you know that we know Gus and the crew of HOPR even before you were born. I sure hope Gus do not read yelp because you are sure to be fired if he did. I know...........because I know him. Lucky for you.........yelp is your saving grace. I was so tempted in telling Gus about what you did. I tipped you 30% my friend.............but why did you still treat us this badly. The food is five star but our server Duy was the worst server ever. I ordered drinks and it took for ever to come. We ordered a second slice and he questioned whether or not we would eat it then threaten us if we didn't finish that his boss, Gus, would be very disappointed and upset. He actually watched us finish the second slice of beef. My SFPD buddy was very upset with him and I told him to be nice. At the end I even gave him a standing ovation for being such a great server sarcastically. I think he knew at that point that he was an asshole to us. I love House of Prime Rib but make sure you do not get this douche bag to be your server,  DUY!!!!</review>

	<review>This is my kinda place!  It feels like you're hanging out in a "den".  It's the kind of place that makes you want to pull out a cigar and sit by the fire.  This is a man's place.  Of course, the women enjoyed it too. Easy to order...  You choose size of cut, doneness, baked or mashed potato, and spinach or corn.  Done.  I'm not even going to comment on the fish.  If you're thinking of ordering fish, why on earth are you going to the House of Prime Rib.  Salad, bread, Yorkshire pudding all come with the meal. Went last night with 8 friends.  I got the House Cut (medium size), cooked medium, mashed, and spinach.  Yum Yum!  Everything was excellent!  Then after we were done eating, our waiter came by and asked if anyone was still hungry, because if so, they could get an extra little bit of everything. I can't understand what some people are complaining about.  The meat was great.  The atmosphere was great.  The service was great.  We were there for almost 3 hours and were never rushed or anything.  All in all a great night.  Definitely will go back.</review>

	<review>I love this place. It has great food and great service. The meal is expensive but well worth it. the atmosphere is nice and it is a change to your everyday sit down restaurant. Come hungry. The portions are a good size and you can also get seconds! They offer an array or horseradish sauces as well as several side dishes that you can choose from. I personally like the cream of spinach and baked potato that you can get as your side</review>

	<review>like this place needs another 5 star review...but i love yelping so here are my 2 cents.  it's probably one of my favorite places to eat at in the city.  you can't really complain...25-30 bucks for a USDA PRIME BEEF prime rib with unlimited salads, sides and yorkshire pudding...AND a complimentary slice of prime rib if your stomach haven't exploded yet.  btw, USDA PRIME BEEF is the highest quality beef you can buy but what makes their prime rib super flavorful is the dry aging process which seals in all the natural juices while the meat itself is naturally tenderized.   in my opinion, one of the finest establishments in the city.</review>

	<review>3.5 stars but obviously I can't do half stars. I do love my meat so what better place to go than House of Prime Rib.  I actually yelped this spot so of course read the reviews before going and then had to check the place out for myself. I dressed in work attire, obviously, since I didn't have any change of clothes for the outing.  I went here with an ex since he wanted to celebrate a so-called anniversary (long story).  Anyway, parking was okay since we were able to park on the street somewhere (I'm not telling you where since it's my little secret and it was fairly close to the restaurant so go find your own...hehe). We arrived at this spot on a fairly late weekend for dinner so we didn't really expect there to be a ton of people at the restaurant.  However, it was a good thing we made reservations because we were proven wrong. We ordered drinks first, I ordered the lemon drop of course, it arrived promptly and it was good.  I moved onto the meal and I ordered the House of Prime Rib cut with the baked potato (fully loaded of course) and mashed potatoes.  Now I know what you are saying...double potatoes?  I do love my potatoes.  If you knew me, you would understand. Anyway, received the food and oh my goodness, I was in heaven.  I didn't even mind that the company was an ex.  I just savored every blissful bite. The meat was cooked to perfection and just how I like it.  I was so tender and so juice.  The potatoes were define, although I would have preferred garIic mashed potatoes rather than gravy but I still ate it.  I was surprised I finished everything.  But, boy was I overly full that I couldn't even dive into the dessert that was rolling by which was too bad. The reason for the three and a half stars is that getting more au jus was a hassle and having a refill of water seemed like a task.  If I received better service, despite my company, they would have had a gleaming 4 or 5 stars without a doubt.  Though, it left me with more to crave. I would definitely come to this place again but with better company of course.  Although, I've heard this place isn't good for kids but I've also heard that a lot of kids have been at this place. Oh well, we'll see if I bring my kids to this place. They'd better be extra hungry to be eating here. Maybe the next time I come here I won't order the double potatoes and order a salad and save the potato for later or vice versa and then see if I could eat another slice of prime rib. Yum!</review>

	<review>Quick summary: this is heaven served on a series of huge plates.   I'm a huge steak lover, so I've eaten at a huge number of steakhouses.  House of Prime Rib is definitely among the best.  The menu is small and to the point.  MEAT and more MEAT!  OK, so they also serve stuff that goes well with meat... The serving sizes are huge.  You start with a humongous salad that's actually really good.  I say "actually" because salads are generally healthy accompaniments at best for me, and slightly dressed up weeds at worst.  I even had to stop myself from eating too much salad, so that I still had room for the steak. The prime rib here is magnificent, as are the sides.  I savor every bite of their succulent servings of prime rib, especially when drenched au jus.  On occasion, I've been motivated to even get a second serving of prime rib.  Also, service has been spot on every time I've gone there. It's too bad they're closed right now (11 pm).  I could use a slice of carnivorous heaven.</review>

	<review>I'm only writing this review because last night's delectable meal deserves at least a few words... Though I am no prime rib connosieur or however you spell it - the meat at HOPR was the most delicious, tender slice of beef I have ever had.  To me, prime rib is bet devoured medium rare and last night was no exception.  The yorkshire pudding (white-people naan) and creamed spinach along with the mashed potatoes and gravy only added to an already tasterific meal. Besides the meal, the service at HOPR was - and it seems a given - as top-notch as any other starred restaurant in the city.  Think Gary Danko-esque multi-server style all in one waiter... beautiful. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful..</review>

	<review>The food is decent, yes only decent. I was expecting more from this place after reading all these fantastic reviews, but everything tasted pretty.... standard. A big hunk of cold meat with mundane sides, I don't think so. I should give them credit for the horseradish though, that was pretty good. The service comprised of episodic scripted presentations glued together with a genuinely unhappy demeanor.</review>

	<review>It's House of fucking Prime Rib.  This place is great. Attentive waiters, great food, great portions. Make reservations ahead of time for if you plan on feasting on some primo meat.  Arrive earlier than you have to, there is only street parking and it's a pain to find an empty spot.  Don't get annoyed if they won't seat you when you're missing people in your group, that's your own damn fault, not theirs.  I saw a rich, smug looking lady yell at the matre d because he told her they couldn't seat them unless their entire party was there and she made a big deal about how much money she makes.  Just because you have money to spend, doesn't mean you have class or tact. King Henry and House of Prime Rib are the most popular cuts.  Of course I always get the King Henry plus seconds when they come back around.  I find it odd when I crave their beet salad (at work, before I fall asleep, you get the picture), it's just so good.  For first timers, it's always visually impressive to see them mix the salad even though it's not really anything impressive when I think about it how they do it, but it is entertaining to see. What I like is that they let my wife and I take some bones home so we can give it to our dog as a treat. I've never had a bad experience here.  I seem to get the same server who always gives us excellent and consistent service.  My wife and I even saw former Mayor Willy Brown here with a very young looking woman in a bare all dress.  Scandalous.</review>

	<review>I came here based on a friends recommendation. I think she likes this place a lot more than I did. You definitely need to make reservations b/c A LOT of ppl come here.  We made reservations for 8PM on Wed nite and it was packed! It's like a destinations for locals and tourist.  Seems like, its like the must go-to place in SF for meat. There's like different prime rib cuts, size and how long its cooked - rare, medium, medium-well, well.   The salad and side is comes with the meal.  You get the house salad with what seems like is water down thousand island dressing (no really my fave dressing). You get a yorkshire pudding (disappointing), baked or mash potato and a choice of either cream spinach (yum) or cream corn. The only three things i really liked from House of Prime Rib was the sourdough bread they bring for the table, cream spinach and well-made cocktails. Overall....It's okay. Service:  Nice Vibe: Warm &amp; Comfy Food: okay</review>

	<review>I don't know why I love this place. Maybe it's because of...everything. I have my HOPR group of friends that frequent here about once a month and no one dares to stray from their usual. Of course, it's actually hard to do that since there's only about 4 choices on the menu. But I love this meal - the meat is always perfectly tender and juicy, the yorkshire pudding is the perfect soaker-upper for all that juice, and the baked potato with all that bacon is so sinful and so delish. I've never, ever been seated on time, but I don't care. I love (finally) scooting into a big cozy booth with a kickass bottle of Cab and some great company for an always-memorable evening.</review>

	<review>So this was supposed to be the main event! Our week long 19th anniversary celebration was to end here, with so many great reviews it could'nt be wrong? Right? WROOONG!!!!! The only food items that are good at this joint is the meat, bread and baked potato if you ask me its over priced. Oh, and the little bottle of snacks they give you while your having some drinks, they were good too. Prime rib - I preferr the end cut with bone, thats were all the flavor is at, tender, juicy and full of flavor Baked potato - i got mine loaded, damn was that huge "thats what she said" sorry been watching too much office, it was all that you would expect a loaded baked potato to taste like 5 stars Bread - who would not like hot sourdough bread with butter? But the cream of corn - needs some serious flavor adjustment the cream of spinach - man was that nasty yorkshire pudding - eh! it was ok,, no flavor but tolerable   salad - nothing to write home about Atmosphere - warm and cozy, perfect lighting So would i go again? Yes if there was a special occasion, would not go just to eat prime rib. But all in all it was nice, plus i was celebrating my 19th anniversary with my wife and loved ones.....</review>

	<review>What can I say about this San Francisco institution that thousands haven't already said before? Growing up in the city, this was my favorite restaurant. I looked forward to holidays and taking out of towners here with my family and went from ordering from the (super value!) kid's menu to a City cut as a teen and more recently a King Henry VII (which proved to be too much) then a downgrade to the English Cut. One thing that keeps me coming back is the consistency and excellent quality of food. They only do prime rib, and hey, they do it damn well. They always start with a fresh salad tossed table side and bread. You can choose 2 sides with your meat and I've always gotten the creamed spinach and mashed potatoes that never disappoint. They also have fresh yorkshire pudding which I used to hate but have learned to enjoy recently! On my last visit in November, I ordered a Manhattan (well drink, but very strong nonetheless) and my dining companion had a Mai Tai (delicious! I should've had one of those instead) while waiting for our reservation in the lounge area. Our server was fairly attentive, but never brought out our loaf of starter bread. We were also sad to know we were not able to to-go our seconds (so wasteful!). With drinks but without dessert, our total for two with tax and tip was ~$130. The reservations here are basically a must, and if you're looking for a weekend, make it at LEAST a month in advance.</review>

	<review>Fine dining establishment that respects traditional values and decor. I am not a big meat eater- but that is not to say I don't eat meat. I just prefer them in small portions. I still do. Just looking at the amount of reviews this restaurant gets should give you a big enough hint that this place is good. I really think they are fair with the price. You get so much sides! The salad (so amazing and flavorful), mashed potato (a total hit with my bf), creamed spinach (good good good), and... Yorkshire pudding. It's not a pudding. It's like an airy pancake that you use to soak up the juices. It is definitely my favorite. They also passed out fresh baked corn bread (yes, it was good). The bread that was the starter was also good. I can taste the freshness of the yeast. So good. I won't forget the meat. It is soft, tender, juicy, flavorful. I am not an expert on meat- but it is seriously good. Save room for dessert if you can. I had their coffee (served in a cute silver kettle) and their creme brulee. They know how to make a dynamite creme brulee. I would come here again. I had fun and you get a lot of food for that price.</review>

	<review>What the heck happened to this place? It used to be that we would order the Henry VIII cut and have enough left over for lunch the next day AND dinner for the dog.. in other words, it was a HUGE cut that neither one of us could finish. Not only that, but it came covered in tons of delicious au jus...and they were so generous with the sides... This time, however, was such a disappointment. Not only was the same cut of meat a 3rd of the size that it used to be (I was able to eat the entire thing in less than 5 minutes and still want more) but the sides were skimpy and the lack of au jus left my Yorkshire pudding, and my meat, d-r-y.. The salad, which used to be piled on the plate, came the size of a fist...and one of the salads was half of even that! Mind you, this was a large party but it was a Monday night so I doubt "running out of meat and sides and lettuce" could have been the reason for such cheap portions. It also would have been nice to have been offered the extra slice had the waiter noticed we went back to eating bread AFTER cleaning off our plates... Perhaps this place is best experienced in smaller groups (less than 5)?</review>

	<review>House of Prime Rib is amazing! The salad and sides are great.  The meat is amazing. And you can get a refill on meat! The ambiance is good - a little bit like a stately old club, somewhere my grandfather would have gone.  They have a nice bar while you're waiting for your reservation.  The downsides are that it's usually crowded, and we often wait, even though we have a reservation. Also, the dining rooms are cramped.</review>

	<review>Delicious food and all you can eat portions. The staff is what makes this a truly remarkable experience. Starting with an energetic welcome and a smile they take your drink order and food order. It was fun watching them make the salad and prepare out baked potatoes table-side. The main course is of course the best. Juicy, tender cuts of meat that seem to melt in your mouth and leaving you both satisfied and yet wanting to lick your lips after. This is a true culinary experience but make sure you bring your appetite.</review>

	<review>Prime Rib me please!!! Wow! HOPR is a wonderful place. I've been coming here for years and I've never been disappointed. The food here is well worth your hard earned money. The deliciousness of the prime rib just melts in your mouth if you leave in there long enough. All the fixin's you get with the meal is just spot on. This place sure does have many fine dining places beat in my book. For a little less than $40 you can have a grand meal. Your prime rib dinner includes a side salad, bread, your choice of mashed or baked potato, yorkshire pudding, and creamed corn or creamed spinach. On top of that all, if you are still hungry you can get a second helping of it all, just in a smaller portion size. However, you cannot get seconds if you have the petite city cut and you cannot take it home. This place is perfect for birthdays, anniversaries, dinner partys, dates, and the family. Reservations are taken, but I tell you now that you must have your party present and get there on time. Sometimes the days will be so busy that even though you have reservations you still might have to wait. Overall, great place for some good prime rib. It's the best bang for your buck here too without charging insane prices like other local steakhouses and eateries. Before I leave here, I'll just leave this to your imagination. When you take cut into that rare or medium rare prime rib, dip it into that au jus, sink your teeth into that morsel of goodness and let it melt on the top of your tongue like butter and slowly chew that goodness, and repeat. Recommendations: ***(my pictures of the goodness is in the pic section)*** - King Henry VIII Cut - House of Prime Rib Cut - Baked Potato with everything - Get seconds, you won't be disappointed</review>

	<review>This place is amazing!   Their service was great all around too! The line was long but the wait wasn't so bad because we were able to sit at a small table while being waited on for drinks.  Once we were seated, the waiter, who I might add was very friendly and professional, came and took our order.  I was impressed by the choice of having pain water and sparkling water.  I ordered the English Cut, which looked small when I saw it, but completely filled me up!  Their meat is perfect!  My husband got the king henry cut and it was off the hook.   But I was in the mood for flavor, which is why I got the English cut.   -great wait tables - Waiter was friendly and quick - we were not charged for a cocktail drink that was suggested by them and we didn't like. - flavor of each item on our plate was amazing!</review>

	<review>The silky smooth jazz pianist from the 50's Nat King Cole once said: "Primarily I'm a meat man, although once in a while I toy with a few vegetables."  I also share his sentiment.  Meat is the primary food of my day, then starches, and then I toy with vegetables.  That brings me to my experience here at House of Prime Rib. When I first stepped foot in the restaurant, my first thought was how warm and cozy the bar area was. I'm ready to pull out a book and have a drink by the fire place. I had a couple diet cokes and while my friends had some drinks. After being seated, orders were taken, fresh hot sourdough was brought to the table with butter. Excellent sourdough by the way. Then the salad show began as our waiter spinned the salad dressing into the salad. It was actually quite entertaining. I was ready for the fire breathers and the hula dancers to come out next. Salad was fresh, dressing was perfect, I'd toy with these vegetables any day. Next came the main course. What else are you going to get but Prime Rib, accompanied by cream spinach and mash potatoes.  The Prime Rib was a thick slice of juicy, perfectly cooked hunk of love. After finishing my first round of Prime Rib, they provided me with another thin slice. What goes better with Prime Rib than more Prime Rib? Spinach cream was rich and a perfect compliment. Mash potatoes were good but a little runny for my taste, but even Irina Shayk has a flaw or two right? In the end I felt full and satisfied. Adding to this, not only good dinner but in my opinion, experience, was that I had my three number one foodie friends to enjoy this experience with. To take a word from the great Nat King Cole, this experience was "unforgettable".</review>

	<review>Still one of my favs ever!!!! Only come here if your in the mood and have the appetite for a large slab of meat. There really isn't anything else to order (hence the name of the restaurant). If you love Prime Rib, this will be the best place you will ever go. Its one of the last restaurants that still serves prime rib from a cart and a spinning salad anywhere. If Lawry's comes to mind, I will Pepsi challenge all your asses to eat at both (HOPR vs. Lawry's BH or LV) and give an honest assesment. Every meal except for one that is prime rib only comes with all the sides you will ever need. You get a salad, your choice of potato (baked or mashed w/gravy), creamed corn or creamed spinach (Also the best I have had. Probably because my friend who used to work there says they pour the prime rib drippings into the spinach. Kind of Gross.), and topped with yorkshire pudding. Desserts are pretty good as well but not very creative. I always get the English Trifle which I can never find anywhere anymore. Also where else can you get an additional extra slice of prime rib and all sides by request? For free? You just ask for the extra slice, and they will ask if you want all the sides. Its pretty much overkill though. If you are still hungry after the first round, you are probably a professional football player. The place is far from perfect though. For a place that is 99% prime rib they have a very limited wine list both by the glass or bottle. We just suck up the corkage fee which is quite reasonable and bring our own cab or bordeaux. Even with reservations you can expect to wait as much as 30 minutes and thats even at first seating at 5:00. I think they know that no matter how long you wait, you will never leave and go down the block. At least I have never seen anyone do it, and I have been going there for 18 years. The service is nice and attentive, but on one occasion years ago, our party of three was seated on a makeshift table for two and I spent the whole evening getting bumped by the prime rib cart. I think they overbooked our time slot and we were the ones that suffered as a result. Still its not like we haven't stopped going.</review>

	<review>I've heard so much about this place. And it didn't let me down. I had the house cut and considering my large appetite and the fact that i didn't eat all day, it wasn't enough for me. Fortunately, they give you extra meat if you aren't satisfied. That is a first for a restaurant or me. I ended up getting two extra pieces and so I thought I got my money's worth. I think next time I'll get the King Henry cut. Also, request the bone if you don't get the King Henry because that's where all the good meat is at. I did love the cream of corn, although the best I've had is still from the Summit House in Brea, CA. I think next time I'll get the baked potato because the mashed potatoes weren't anything special. Otherwise, great service, great atmosphere, and great food. What more can you ask for?</review>

	<review>So this is the place that all my friends have been talking and making a commotion about. I don't doubt that the place is a definite must-visit when you go to San Francisco, but I just had a bad experience with it. I was always told that you can get all-you-can-eat Prime Rib here, but the lady who has been working there for 18 years tells me that I cannot?!? And not only that, she tells me that the second piece she gave me (a measly portion that even dogs would complain about) was given to me by good gesture. I wouldn't be complaining if I weren't still hungry after leaving this place and I'm just a skinny guy! The point is, don't expect much tip if you cannot please your customer.</review>

	<review>Coming to the House of Prime Rib brings back memories.  It was a frequent stop for family special occasions, or when we had overseas guests in town.  Come with lots of room, because this place gives you a LOT of food.  The menu is simple...just pick your cut of meat and choose from a few side options, and you're ready to go. -Salad: What is it about this salad that makes it so good?  I asked the waiter once what the dressing was, and he said a secret.  That's one good secret dressing! -Potato:  Either mashed or baked.  I always get a loaded baked potato. -Creamy goodness: Either corn or spinach.  Spinach all the way! -Bread pudding -Meat:  Gotta go medium rare.  At first it looks like they over-drench it in au jus sauce, but by the end it gets all soaked up into the cut for a really juicy, delicious prime rib. Side notes: -Don't fill up on bread.  It's just not worth it! -2nd complimentary piece of meat if you finish your first -Extensive dessert menu....if you can handle it -There is a limit to reservations (10 people) on Fridays and weekends I've always had friendly, attentive service here, even when the dining room is bursting with diners.</review>

	<review>I'm sorry to do this but I have to because it seems that when good restaurants know that they're good.. they stop trying and it starts to become bad. I've been here a few times in my life and I've grown up and lived in the city all my life. This place has always had a great reputation and from my other past experiences I'd have to agree. Our waiters were always really fun, entertaining and friendly. The food never disappointing. But I can't say that about our experience tonight. The night started out great. Five of us here to celebrate 2 of our birthdays and we got the drinks right.. cosmos.. delish.. Food came soon after and it was as usual Yum-O!! stuffed my face with their sourdough.. its my favorite... so good, I'm"m willing to get fat for it! My roommate who sat next to me ate half of his HofPR cut and put it on my plate for me to finish... I was still working on mine... I was pretty determine to finish... I ate both his and mine at the same time - to compare the two cuts.. he had a more rare cut and it was sweeter. So since I took his food, he asked for a 2nd cut, one slice of English cut. They gave it to him and he ate the whole thing. This has always been their thing... that if you wanted a 2nd piece, you are welcome to it. So for how much we paid (for drinks and food) we got lectured / talked shit to by our waiter Duy. When my roommate asked for my food (which had a small piece of his cut combined) to be packed to go... Duy, our waiter, said to us in a stern/jerk-ish tone "... you know I can get in really big trouble for that..." pointing to my plate of meats... as he gives us that "you're not getting away without me telling you off" look... GOD! That seriously totally ruined our buzz and our night was totally ruined! That was our birthday celebration and with one stupid waiter and his stupid insistent that one little piece of meat will get him in trouble and therefore it gives him the right to fuck up our night is not cool! WTF is right. I've not been so upset at service at a particular restaurant in a really long time. I don't even know if I want to come back.. might just give in to the longer drive and go to Broadway Prime in San Mateo.</review>

	<review>I've been going to this place for the last 15 years and it's still the best prime rib in SF Bay Area for a reasonable price.  The sides are delicious as well.  They offer creamed spinach, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, mash potatoes with gravy, and recently they've added creamed corn.  I usually have a hard time deciding which sides I would like since they are all very good.  All dishes come with the Yorkshire pudding which is very fluffy and melts in your mouth.   To top it all off, they offer seconds!!!  I've never made it to seconds since the first slice of meat is very generous but thought that was an extra bang for the buck.   The only caution is parking is a bitch unless you decide to valet.</review>

	<review>The day we got back from Burning Man 2006, I asked my friend Nick "what do you want to be your first off-playa meal?" and he replied, "Steak.  I want a big hunk of meat."  So, I chose the House of Prime Rib, and we were not disappointed.  We made a reservation, and when we arrived, we had cocktails in the drawing room next to the fireplace, and then when our table was ready, they brought our drinks right over.  The drinks were huge and were accompanied with small carafes containing what was left over in the cocktail shaker but wouldn't fit in the glass. The whole restaurant has a real clubby feel to it - very old fashioned and Continental.  The menu is small and the food is simple - you won't get any frilly hipster food here.  We had thick slabs of tender, juicy prime rib which damn near melted in our mouths.  The sides weren't anything fancy, but they were tasty in that comfort food kind of way - creamed spinach, caesar salad (prepared tableside!) and baked potato. Our post-playa meat cravings were sufficiently fulfilled and we settled back in our leather booth for a post-dinner drink.  Ahhh! I'm surprised to see other reviewers complain about bad service - our service was top-notch and very friendly.</review>

	<review>Being something of a San Francisco institution, I had heard of &amp; known about House of Prime Rib for a long time now. Despite this, I had somehow never gotten around to eating at HOPR, but that all changed recently on my birthday thanks to the girlfriend. For this year's birthday I wanted to keep it small, so it was just me, the girlfriend &amp; my brother from another mother (a friend from so far back into childhood that some memories become obscured by the fog of time). We arrived early for our reservations. The hostess offered sitting at the bar until our table was ready as an option. It was an offer that could not be refused. The bartender was very friendly &amp; very professional, maybe even a touch classy. My friend &amp; I had Knob Creek Manhattans &amp; the girlfriend had a Dirty Martini. Our drinks were additionally served with the cocktail shaker which had a full refill in it, nice. My Manhattan was spot on. When our table was ready, the bartender made a minor goof ringing up our tab. Inconsequential really, but the manager felt the need to come by, apologize &amp; spot us a free round of drinks. Not a problem, forgiveness comes so much more easily after being given free liquor. Once seated at our table, we were greeted by our waiter. He was quite the character; being somewhat surly &amp; acerbic, but entertainingly so. He rattled off his spiel on how to order at HOPR &amp; we ordered promptly. We all ordered prime rib (surprise, surprise), just different sizes &amp; degree of wellness. I got the King Henry VIII Cut done rare. In addition to whichever particular slab of beef you pick, dinners at HOPR come with: a Salad Bowl, Mashed Potatoes or Baked Potato, Yorkshire Pudding &amp; Creamed Spinach. Right after ordering, a very large party was seated next to us &amp; began monopolizing our waiter's time. After waiting a bit, we were getting hungry &amp; antsy. Making eye contact with him, he could tell our patience was running thin &amp; he dispatched a busser to begin serving us food. Soon enough, food began arriving in stages. Then there was that magical moment when the HOPR trademark prime rib serving cart, a stainless steel zeppelin on wheels filled with beef, graced our table. The feast had officially begun. Salad, baked potato, Yorkshire pudding, creamed spinach, it was all excellent &amp; the meat, of course, was magnificent melt-in-your-mouth morsels of moo cow. Wow, so good, so very good. We all thoroughly cleaned our plates, blissfully stuffing ourselves in the process. Regardless of this, we somehow managed to find just enough room for dessert. Creme brulee was the choice &amp; it was superb, like everything else. The feast was concluded &amp; we were joyously sated. Thanks to the girlfriend, I had a great time &amp; fantastic food at House of Prime Rib on my birthday. I remember during a conversation with our waiter, I mentioned it was my 1st time at HOPR &amp; he asked "where have you been?" A valid question considering how impressive &amp; fun the whole evening had been. It had taken me far too long to come here the 1st time; it certainly won't be long before I'm back.</review>

	<review>After seeing this place being featured on Food Network (Best Thing I've Ever Ate) and the Travel channel, I knew it would be a place to try when visiting in San Fran. We made reservations the day before and was able to take the cab there with 15 mins to spare before our actual reservation time. The host was pretty rude as we asked if we can be seated since we were 15 mins early. He told us to sit in the bar and wait because it wasn't 5:30pm yet. Great. We waited for 25 mins before we were finally seated which defeated the purpose of an reservation when it goes over the actual time. -_- Once we were seated, it was already clear what we were going to order.. PRIME RIB!! Fiance got the King Henry VIII cut.. while I opted for the House of Prime cut. Both came with salad, yorkshire pudding, cream of spinach, and loaded baked potatoes. We also requested for the corn bread which we were lucky enough to get by the end of the meal. :) Everything was really good and the prime rib was perfectly cooked to the way we liked it. The silver cart was next to us the entire time while the chef cut each table's orders so we were drooling even though we were stuffed! Prices were decent for the quality of the meal (about $40 per person) and I definitely took home leftovers enough for the two of us the next day! Our waiter was really nice and definitely wasn't rude like the host so I guess it's a hit or miss for service. He was nice enough to check if they can make some corn bread for us just because we requested for it. He did mention that it comes out whenever so it's not a set time on when they make it. Definitely will be coming back here but won't be till another couple of years for the prime rib to "digest". haha...</review>

	<review>I love this place! I've been going here for years since I was a kid, and I love the service, food, and interior. I usually eat the full course meaning entree to dessert. I normally order the English cut since it's easier to cut, and their isn't a giant bone attached to it, mashed potatoes, and cream of spinach. When I was a kid, I used to be turned off by the cream of spinach mainly because I had no idea what it was since it was green, and was new to me but it grew on me eventually (after finding out what it was of course). I love their desserts too! Their interior design is bit dark, but gives it that romantic feel, except note there are tons of customers, so it is bound to be a bit noisy. It's definitely a dressy place in my opinion, but the price is worth every bit of it. I remember I went in there once wearing a hoodie and some jeans, though I didn't feel out of place, it was more like "I wish I dressed better" kind of moment. There are also fish too if people don't eat meat, or prefer to eat on the lighter side.</review>

	<review>Massive cuts of beef and traditional english sides have made House of Prime Rib a landmark destination. Make a reservation well in advance and show up with your entire party, else you might lose your table. As Anthony Bourdin rants, "a temple of old-school meat, everything that is unfashionable, everything that is wrong." And yet the crowds say differently. It's packed. The prime rib cart, a gleaming, stainless steel contraption about the size of a small car, wheels up to our table. It's filled with enormous cuts of corn-fed beef, a sight that might even overwhelm carnivores. The meat is backlit within the trolley, which adds a strange touch of drama to the proceedings. The server cuts off a slice to your specifications: a "small" city cut, a thick house of prime rib cut, a thin but large english cut, and the King Henry VIII cut, the largest and most overwhelming. You can order a children's prime rib dinner for kiddos 8 and under or fresh fish, which varies according to market. Every dinner comes with sides. Taken alone, they aren't anything special. But combined into a whole meal, it's brilliant. The creamed spinach with bacon, massive baked potato, and yorkshire pudding were a great combination. I could do without the house salad next time. The performance is definitely an experience, which is fun for a group. Holiday time was a great choice because teh holly garlands, Christmas lights, and festive atmosphere really kicked up our party's spirits.</review>

	<review>I love the House of Prime Rib. I've tried nearly every steak house in the city, including Harris', Izzy's, Ruth's Chris and Morton's, and have to say that HOPR is the best, BY FAR. What makes this place so good? There are four reasons: Great steak, amazing drinks, unbelievable sides and fun atmosphere. On top of the factors I just listed, they offer one of the best beet salads I've ever had and offer seconds on their prime rib! Yes, let me repeat, they offer SECONDS on their prime rib! No other steak house I know of does this and makes me love this place even more. Prices are also very reasonable. Bottom line --- if you are a steak lover (and in particular, a fan of prime rib) this is your place. It's also the best dirty martini in the city (and that I've ever had).</review>

	<review>My bf and I came here for a romantic dinner.  We were so impressed with the experience.  Service was excellent.  The food was so delicious, even the bread was fresh and crispy.  The salad was simple but flavorful and the little spin trick they do when they mix the salad at your table was definitely a signature move on the restaurant's part.  We ordered the King size prime rib, and it was HUGE!  The piece just cut through like butter and was so delicious.  We love prime rib, so HOPR's prime rib is the best prime rib we have ever had.  We really enjoyed our romantic dinner here and HOPR is on our top list for favorite restaurants now.</review>

	<review>I always have a good experience here whether we get a reservation in on the day of or not.  This place can't disappoint me.  I love their dining room as well as the lounge area because it has a warm feel to the place.  I always get the small cut because i know that it's big enough for me already.  I love the amount of sides we get and I love their wait service.  It may be pretty pricey but its what i expect from San Francisco dining and Harris being just down the street.   This is a nice celebration place for getting a new job, engagement or birthday.</review>

	<review>I'm going to start this review with an apology. An apology for my goodhearted friend who invited me out to dinner here last night. I know she loves this place and she talked a good game about the awesomeness of it, but... this was terrible. I had been warned about the bridge and tunnel types that come here. I was told it was the kind of place that people from Vallejo (no offense if you hail from Vallejo) come for special nights out on the town or the kind of place that people come to celebrate their birthdays (for the record, we heard Happy Birthday sung 5 times in the hour we were there.) But I never really thought it could be THAT bad. For starters, the prime rib was awful. I know prime rib can lean towards the fatty side, but this was straight up gummy. Gross. The creamed spinach that lured me in with the promise of bacon, was almost inedible. It tasted more like Bac-O-Bits than bacon. The baked potato was the highlight as it came funny loaded with chives and the same Bac-O-Bits from the spinach. Hooray. About the best thing about my meal here was the martini I had. It was amazing. But I ask you, dear eaters and drinkers of the world, is it really that hard to screw up a martini? Yeah, not saying much for the meal I had here and at $70 with tip, I definitely won't be returning.</review>

	<review>CV and Jacky invited us to dinner. Of course, HOPR was atop the list for Clarence's restaurant choices. Being that they had just got hitched over the weekend, they wanted to thank everybody for a job well done. More importantly, it gave us a chance to unwind and reflect on what an awesome weekend it was. Nina and I were late, but we had good reason. We were in Lake Tahoe celebrating our 1 year anniversary. Congratulations to us! As a surprise we headed to Tahoe immediately after the wedding for a couple of days of rest, love and horseback riding. So back to the dinner, whenever I go to this place there is always a gentleman who seems to remember me. Or at least he pretends to remember me, he is older but he is always willing to make it seem like I am regular. I love that about this place.  It makes the fact that you and your friends are about to drop 6 bills on beef and alcohol more tolerable. Will I go back? Absolutely. It is like the theme from Cheers' - A place where everybody knows your name.... Gotta love it.</review>

	<review>Holy cow, this place is awesome! My date picked this place so I had no idea what to expect, but I was very pleased with the overall experience here. I felt a little overdressed because many people were wearing jeans with a nice top on, but I got complimented by the hostess and waiter, so I didn't mind TOO much. =) Anyway, back to the food. I thought it was pretty funny how they brought us their freshly cooked sourdough bread with a huge knife sticking on top of it. It really set the tone for what was to come.. This isn't a place for wussies! The bread was freshly baked, warm, crunchy on the outside, and tasted very good with some butter lathered on it. I got the English Cut- their house prime rib cut in 3 thinner slices which was served with a generous portion of mashed potatoes with gravy, creamed corn, bowl of salad and Yorkshire Pudding. I savored every bite of my prime rib and I was glad I got the thinner slices because it seemed to have more flavor than some other thicker cuts of prime rib I've had before. Their mashed potatoes complimented the meat so well, I was savoring every bite of my delicious meal. Their creamed corn was mediocre, I've had better. However, their bowl of salad was huge and their seasoning tasted pretty good. I didn't get to try any of the Yorkshire Pudding because I was too full by the end of the meal to even take one bite of it. I tried some of my date's creamed spinach, which was pretty decent and his baked potato was LOADED with a generous helping of bacon bits. I had to steal some of that, of course. The interior is your typical old school, classic steakhouse. The booth I was sitting at seemed a bit outdated though. There were a few people that were dressed up, but the next time I go here, I probably would just go business casual. My waist size will probably increase by the end of my meal anyway. Jeans it is! Do NOT count calories here and you will be very very happy. All of this delicious food for under $40!! What a steal! This restaurant has restored my love for prime rib, once again.</review>

	<review>My first night in SF was last night. My Mom lives in Vallejo, CA near Napa so she met me in SF for dinner. She' s a total MEAT EATER, and her taste in restaurants is questionable at best. I often joke that I HAD to have been switched at birth! (She can take a joke) So, knowing her taste, and love of Prime Rib...I actually chose this place. It was right up her alley! (not mine) Mom's likes family-feeling places and Buffets (eek!). lol I love my mom, really I do. We just don't see eye-to-eye when it comes to food. HOPR is an 'old folgie' place, with lots of... old people, not a "hip" person in sight. This is definitely no MASTRO'S Beverly Hills. Buuuuuuuut, Moms dug it, so it was a good time. And, she was taking me out so I knew she could live with the price: $34 a person. I, being a vegetarian on the other hand... discovered why they call this place the House of Prime Rib...IT'S ALL THEY SERVE. No lobster, no shrimp, no fish, nada! You have a choice only of what CUT of prime to have. All sides are included. We both had the 'City Cut' (their petite portion). My mom  really liked her Prime Rib, tore into the warm sourdough bread, and was all over the yorkshire pudding.  Personally, the food looked very 'cafeteria' and lackluster...in color. Many years ago, there use to be a place in Universal City, CA called Ruben's (anyone remember it?) They had a great prime rib, back when I ate meat. But, I digress... (I'll add photos to this review) I ate my sides and my mom gave my uneaten prime rib to a homeless person outside the restaurant. Before the homeless dude would take it, he asked my Mom what kind of food it was first! lol  I said, "See Mom, in L.A., my bums would take the food and ask questions later. BUT SF bums--- they have discriminating palates !" UPDATE My Mom gives me 1 star for reviewing a prime rib place and not eating the prime rib. lol I give her 5 stars for being right and a prime rib pro--she loved this place!</review>

	<review>Honestly, this is the go-to Prime-rib spot in the city, but if I was in LA, I would totally go to Lawrys. Lawrys has amazing sides and spinning bowl salad and HOPR can't beat it for some sad reason... : / House of prime rib, has just O-K sides (spinach, cream corn, potatoes, salad) but the Prime-rib is stillllll amazing. I always get the Prime-cut and although I can never finish it, I take my other half home for the next day and it is still SUPERB.The service here is always good and very attentive. i've had their desserts, they're good but not wow. I do so often switch between Harris and HOPR, depending what I'm in the mood for, steak or prime rib. Many compare the two, but honestly they are just excellent for their own traditional course.</review>

	<review>First off do yourself a favor and use their valet parking service. It's worth it, for $15; you don't have to drive around looking for parking that is not there, if you park at a parking garage it is about the same price or more, plus...you don't have to walk far. The ladies will really appreciate it, especially when wearing high heels. This place is extremely busy! You will definitely need to make a reservation if you want to go here. Even with reservation we had to wait about an hour to be seated. We were in no hurry, so waiting was not a big deal for us. They have a very cozy cocktail lounge area with a big fireplace where you can order your drinks and wait. It made waiting actually kinda nice. It gave my husband and I a chance to enjoy our cocktails, unwind, and chat - something we don't get to do at home, now that we have two little babies (15 and 5 months old). If you want prime rib this is the place! You will need to fast before you go here, they serve a full course meal and the portions are huge! The prime ribs are carted to you in a big tin roaster, and a piece of your choice is cut off for you at your table. The staffs are very professional and friendly. Our waitress was very sweet and attentive. She met our needs without hovering over our shoulder. When asked for wine pairing recommendation - she recommended a bottle of 2009 Groth Cabernet Sauvignon. It was perfect with the prime rib! We enjoyed it so much we ordered two bottles! A nice place to dress up and go for a date. The lights are dimmed. It's very romantic. If you like prime rib I highly recommend this place!</review>

	<review>Sunday afternoon. Parked across the street from HoPR. While waiting, I look over and see HoPR glistening in the afternoon sunshine. Helping a friend move in the neighborhood, and she was going to treat dinner. I knew I wanted HoPR, but I also had to convince the third person. I go to OpenTable, look for a table of three for that night. Luckily they had a spot at 8p! Terrific. I book it, since there's no cost to book with OpenTable. We had plenty to do that afternoon, by the time 730p rolled around we were almost done and started to get clean up for dinner. The walk to HoPR literally took about three minutes, footsteps away. We go in about ten to the hour, check in, waited in the quiet hallway around from the bar. The wait wasn't too bad, about 15min. We got seated in the back center room. In a booth. We ordered (I got HoPR Cut with mash), got served, got fed, cleaned my plate sans bone, got seconds (with creamed spinach), got full, ordered creme brulee, got overfull. YUM. Been coming here for... um... ten or so visits in over a decade.</review>

	<review>We ate here last night and it was great to note that it was full on a Tuesday night. It was a good thing I made reservations. The ambiance was ok, it was dimly lit and a little too loud in some areas. Our server, April, was excellent. Now on to the food. I tried the City cut while my bf had the House cut and we both ordered our meat cooked medium rare. I normally order medium rare, and have not had my meat taste so cold before. Possibly moving the meat around in carts isn't conducive to keeping the food as warm as it should. Neither one of us was particularly impressed by the meat. Both the mashed potatoes and baked potatoes were hot and tasted great. I wasn't a big fan of the creamed corn or the creamed spinach, however, creamed vegetables aren't something that I enjoy much anyway. If it were not for the wine at the bar while waiting for our seats and champagne during dinner, we wouldn't have had anything to be excited about. I really wanted to like this place, but it just doesn't compare to the dinner I had at Ruth's Chris, so I will have to give it a 3.</review>

	<review>This was a tough one to rate. If I could give the place 4.5 stars I would. What makes this place interesting is it is very similar to Lawry's (in Beverly Hills) which is my all time favorite Prime Rib restaurant. The similarities are uncanny. From the prime rib carts, spinning salad bowl, creamed spinach/corn, and even the yorkshire pudding is the same. The quality is also comparable. So, if you like Lawry's you will not be disappointed going here. The service was also impeccable, and the atmosphere is what you expect from a high end steak house. To date, I would say this is the best steakhouse I have had in the bay area.</review>

	<review>I have been going to HPR for several years now.  The service is excellent. I might be biased because I frequent the place, but I have never been disappointed.  I love the ambiance, the food, and it was the first place that I tried La Crema, which is now my favorite Chardonnay.  If you order a cocktail, you get the remainder of the cocktail in the shaker, which needless to say will get you feeling quite buzzed.  I usually get the City Cut which is the smallest portion.  If you get the Largest portion, and have a dog at home, you can ask for a bone to take home.  Your dog will love you for an eternity.  Lastly, you can ask to try their home made horse radish that is not on the menu.  Horse radish lovers will be quite pleased!</review>

	<review>ooooo i love going here.  Nice juicy tender prime rib along with all the sides.  The potatoes mashed or baked will never leave you feeling disappointed, plus it's neighboring creamy spinach is to drool over.  I can have a meal with the sides alone.  The bartender are friendly and will let you have a sample of drinks they make.  The wait is usually long therefore reservations are suggested.</review>

	<review>OK, first off, let me get the one (pretty big) negative here out of the way. They SUCK SUCK SUCK as far as getting you seated on time or being anywhere close to reservation time or estimated wait.  It's just a joke.  And if you have 14 of 15 in your party there on time they will give you some song and dance about not being able to seat you (so obviously the big group answer is "yes, we're all here."  As long as you know that anytime after about 6pm you are gonna wait a minimum of 30 minutes (and sometimes longer, though they will generally hook you up with some dessert or a drink or something if the wait is really ridiculous) at the bar for your table, everything's cool.  But just know that going in so you don't get pissed off. Now, on to the positives. Very simple.  They have a cart with delicious prime rib.  And sides.  And that's what you eat.  For a set price.  There are no surprises here.  They do one thing and do it well.  Now, on to the details. Your options are various cuts of prime rib for $32 to $38.  I usually get the standard House of Prime Rib cut for $35, but last time tried the thinner English cut at the same price.  HOPR cut is what you expect for prime rib.  English cut is thin slices.  Both are delicious, but I prefer the traditional thick HOPR cut.  You can also get the small City cut, but if you're a guy, your friends should make fun of you for that.  And for show-offs there's the King Henry the VIIIth cut.  Which I guess is a bold and alpha male type choice. Note that if you polish off your meat, they'll offer to cut you off an extra piece.  Back in my younger days, I did that once or twice.  Now the very thought of it just seems ridiculous. Dinner starts with some really tasty hot bread (don't fill up on it, it's tempting!) and I think maybe a cornbread muffin or something, then a chopped salad bowl that they spin in an icy bowl and drizzle in some delicious dressing.  Just say yes to whatever they ask, it's delicious.  The chilled fork they give you is a nice touch. With your meal, you can choose mashed potatoes or baked potato.  Both good choices, but I usually go with the baked potato with the works, which is a bunch of unhealthy stuff.  Last time I went a friend asked for some bacon as well and they made that happen.  Nice. They've added another choice now, creamed spinach or creamed corn.  This is easy, since the creamed spinach is pretty tasty (not incredible, but solid) and the creamed corn is gross. And you get some yorkshire pudding.  You used to get a big piece, now it's pretty small.  But don't worry.  If you like it, just say so and they'll hook you up with as much of it as you like. You also get a wide option of horseradish choices.  Most are creamy horseradish sauces that aren't very spicy.  They'll gladly hook you up with regular horseradish.  I like to get a little bit of the spiciest horseradish sauce along with a plate of regular horseradish.  I am a bigger fan of horseradish than normal people, though. The staff here is pleasant and the prime rib cart guys especially rule. If you somehow have room for desserts, they are all pretty basic and quite tasty and in huge portions. This place is really great for big group dinners like birthday parties (as long as everyone eats beef!). I guess they do have a fish option on the menu.  I wouldn't count on that knocking your socks off, though. This place does prime rib plates, and they do it well.  It's not innovative or fancy or creative.  Just good plates of food at a good price.  They tell you exactly what they're gonna do and deliver.</review>

	<review>This place has a million reviews so clearly, there isn't much to add. I will say it's the first time I've ever had prime rib and I think this will be the only place I can ever have it. It just melts. The staff was absolutely amazing, not pretentious in the least. We started with martinis that came with an entire pint glass of refills. No exaggeration. We got three martinis out of it and they were only about $8 to begin with. This and the fact that your meal CAME with all the sides was mind boggling. At every other steakhouse I've been to everything is a la carte and adds up REAL fast. The spinach was creamy and bacony, the mashed potatoes were absurdly good, the bread was hot, the salad interesting (who knew I liked beets?) and the Yorkshire pudding a great sponge for the jus. I wish we lived in this city so we could take advantage of this place more often!</review>

	<review>People who love prime rib, next time just walk down one block and go to Harris, because it's seriously 10 times better than this "House of Prime Rib" here. I've been to this shitty place 2 times and both times I had to wait for more than an hour, the place is like a farmer's market, everybody is loud as hell, laughing and talking like freaking hyenas. I'm a talker myself, but trust me, people in there is LOUD. Service is always SLOWWWW, they feed you tons of bread and salad, not like those are any good to begin with, then they serve you the prime rib so you won't ask for seconds. Cheap asses. This place is OVER-RATED, people go there because of its name, maybe it's not 1 star bad, but the experiences I had with them was just that bad. For true prime rib lovers out there, take my word and try Harris Streak House down the street at Van Ness and Pacific, service is A LOT better, food is 10X better. TRUST ME!</review>

	<review>Came here with a friend and wasn't quite sure what to expect or if we were even going to be able to get a table being that we had no reservations. I was told that I could be put on the walk-in list which had about a 40 minute wait. At that point I had driven quite a while trying to find a good, new place to eat so we sat in the lounge and waited the 40 minutes for the table. The service was great, salad prepared tableside, a second serving of prime rib if you finish your first, prime rib carved at a cart at your table, baked potato also prepared tableside, etc. They really do take care of you and made us feel welcome despite the fact that we were dressed down. The food was ok. The prime rib had a great texture but the flavor just wasn't all there for me. The juices on the plate were delicious and the yorkshire pudding they give you with your meal soaks it up nicely. I thought that the beef at bobo's was a little better as far as curing, flavor, etc. but the service at HOPR is definitely better, they really do seem to go all out to make you feel like a king. Definitely would return!</review>

	<review>One can only imagine how long our culture has viewed the consumption of mass quantities of meat, getting drunk and spending money as wholesome male bonding. I briefly pondered this mystery before crying like a little girl. At my friend's insistence I had shoved an entire, raw spoonful of horseradish sauce down my throat. The laughing sadists sharing my table convinced me that all virgin HOPR diners had to perform this ritual. What better way to remember your first HOPR meal - at this meat mecca, this bovine bounty, this cornucopia of cow, this house of... ok you get it. At least I didn't have to swallow the hot stuff, that stuff is *insane*. The simplicity of the menu is appealing, especially to cro-magnon reading skills. Just pick a size and your sides. The veteran meat commandos at the table waxed philosophical with wisdom on how I should proceed. "Watch out for the breadsticks and salad, they're delicious but don't fill up!" "Maybe if we're not too late, we can score some corn bread, but remember, don't fill up!" "No matter what, don't get the Princess Cut or we'll hurt you. And if you do, you won't fill up." I avoided the smallest portion known as the Princess Cut but still got punched for ordering wine not beer. I opted for the English cut and was pleased with the tender, juicy thin beef. The bread (especially corn) and salad and sides were also great. Nothing mind-blowing, but tastier than Sizzler. Unfortunately the service was cud-chewing slow. Not even the benihana salad spinning could save the experience. The entire process took over four hours. In addition to eating, telling insulting jokes, drinking and basic manly crudeness, we waited an hour at the bar for seating, 20 minutes DYING of starvation for bread, 20 minutes for salad, 20 minutes for our entree, 20 minutes trying to get our check. Which is why I won't be returning, despite its pluses. Or maybe it's that I hear it's custom to make the second timers swallow the hot horseradish!</review>

	<review>Little ol me got the King cut. Each cut comes with a slab of yorkshire pudding, salad (just an ordinary iceberg lettuce house salad - you do not get a choice), your choice of cream of corn or creamed spinach, and your choice of a baked potato with sour cream, bacon, and butter or mashed potatoes. I had the creamed spinach and a humongous baked potato. The salad gets prepared next to your table in a very grandiose manner - pretty entertaining. The meat cart comes to your table and your slice gets cut in front of you. That's how it goes for everyone. For me and my friends (a hearty eater and a pregnant woman), we experienced a couple of incidents that made our dinner less enjoyable. Our server was Brian, a tall Asian guy (if you were wondering). If I were to ever come back, I do not want him as my waiter again. One of my friends was served an end piece of a medium prime rib roast, however the end pieces tend to be well done. The middle parts are medium. My friend politely requested a different piece and it was met with attitude - more from Brian than the guy who cut the meat. Another incident occurred with my other friend. Earlier in our dinner we noticed a older white gentleman who ordered a baked potato but asked to taste the mashed potatoes. Brian nicely gave it to him. My friend also ordered the baked potato and wanted to try the mashed potatoes. When he asked Brian, his request was granted but all of us at the table noticed the attitude and irritation he unsuccessfully tried to hide. Though the portions are large, if you get the King Cut,  you can ask for a second slice however if you don't finish it, you can not take it home. This is clearly stated on the menu - kinda tacky for an upscale restaurant. One nice aspect was the valet parking! Cheap for SF and very convenient on this busy street! Overall, medium quality food at a high price by an insensitive wait person. I am not sure if I will ever come back...but I can say that I will be trying other steak houses before considering the House of Prime Rib! "Medium quality food" is an overstatement. When I got home, my bowels were hating me.</review>

	<review>So we weren't the only ones kept waiting???  Seeing from the other Yelps I can agree that this place certainly loves to make you wait. I ate entirely too much bread while, once again waiting, that I felt sick the entire time I was eating my prime.  That paired with seeing my buddy throw back 3 BIG ones was a deadly pair. The salad was great - really fresh, interesting and plain old good.  The prime was fine, I mean prime is prime but for the money I guess I expected more.  The creamed corn was okay, I got it as the other people I was dining with seemed to be getting spinach, so I thought "what the heck, I'll get the corn"  The joke was on me as I thought the spinach was better. So if you want expensive fine prime rib, go here.  If you don't, do yourself a favor and don't!</review>

	<review>Went to HOPR for a friend's birthday about a month ago.  I had always wanted to try this place even though I'm not a huge fan of prime rib.  I have had already tried various other restaurants' prime rib cuts such as from Alexander's Steakhouse, Lawry's the Prime Rib, and Donovan's Steakhouse.  I can easily say that Donovan's Steakhouse's prime rib was the best prime rib I have ever had.  I had high expectations going into HOPR since it is prestigious in the Bay Area. To be honest, it was not as good as the prime rib I had at Donovan's.  I want to say it wasn't even as good as the prime rib I had at Lawry's, but I had Lawry's about 4 years ago so it's hard to say.  Nonetheless, the prime rib was quite juicy, but the flavors just didn't appeal to me as much as other prime rib's I've had.  The sides were quite generous though, which I enjoyed.  I got the stuffed potato and that was delicious.  By stuffed, I mean STUFFED. You can also get seconds on your prime rib (free), but none of us at our table had the stomach for it. HOPR still probably is the best prime rib restaurant in the Bay Area, but I probably will not visit it again (but mainly because I'm more of a steak guy than prime rib).  If you're into prime rib it is definitely worth checking out.</review>

	<review>I used to like house of prime rib and came here regularly. But in the past few years, it has definitely slipped.  I went here recently on a Friday night and the restaurant definitely did not seem as busy as it normally do.  The bread is still warm and tasty and the salad is still great, albeit way too much dressing.  But the main thing that I was most disappointed about was the meat. First off, I ordered a medium rare and when I got my order, it way over cooked.  I shoud've complained but gave it the benefit of the doubt that it would still be tasty. But the meat was not tender at all, in fact, I find Costco prime rib to be of better quality.  And the dish was really bland.  I just did not enjoy it.  Given all the good restaurants in the bay area, there is just no really any reason to return to here anymore. I was quite sad b/c this used to be so much better.</review>

	<review>I've always preferred Prime Rib over steak, and HOPR is definitely the place for great Prime Rib!  Like others have mentioned, the wait is definitely something they need to improve on.  I've been frequeting HOPR since I was a little kid (we used to come here every year during the holidays), and without a doubt, you always end up waiting around an 1 hour past your reservation.  It's become so expected, that I don't even think to complain about it. So now that you've waited in the lounge area for an hour and you're finally seated, you really only have a few choices... Prime Rib, or fish.  If you thinking of ordering the fish, you should just not come here.  What I like about HOPR is that they make ordering easy.  All you have to think about is what kind of cut you want, and whether you prefer mashed or baked potato.  The salad, yorkshire pudding, creamed spinach, are all part of the meal, and they give you a plenty! The salad is probably my least favorite because of the beets and excessive amount of dressing.  I love the yorkshire pudding, and the baked potato is always a favorite.  My prime rib is always cooked perfectly, and they even give you seconds!   Overall the price is very reasonable for what you get, and you always come out satisfied.  What not to like?</review>

	<review>Mr. Steiner? Mr. Randall? Synchronize watches. Request for time to look over the menu: denied. The whole table's orders taken all at once. Wines binder readjusted to a certain angle. Food toppings whether you want them or not. Utensils, dishes repositioned before your eyes. Unused wine glasses repossessed. We hadn't  time to browse the menu anyway. Wasn't sure if I could pick up my fork. Or place it back down without permission. Cornbread: not Southern. I repeat: not Southern. Attire: Dressy. But dude had a white v-neck tee. So tempted to click "Ambience: Hipster". Accommodations, service: polite, semiformal. Overall interesting though slightly off-putting. A highly mechanized, autonomous affair. Just under 3 stars for House of Optimus Rib.</review>

	<review>Edit: I like the food here, but the service in the front is very rude. It's always the same host, and he's terrible. The last time I went, I didn't have reservations but there were only 3 of us. I asked him how long the wait would be, and he said around 30 minutes. 30 minutes later I ask what's up, and he says it should be 20-30 minutes. Another 30 minutes go by and I ask, and he says there's no way to tell how long it'll be. Um...your one job is to fucking seat people, I would think knowing an estimate on how long the wait would be would rank pretty high up there with being competent enough to answer the phone and write down a name. I *might* eat here again if I had a reservation and did not have to deal with the donkeys in the front, but I would pick a nice steakhouse over this place any day. ---- While I don't wanna overhype this place like it already is, it is pretty damn good. They have a few options of cuts available - from the House of Prime Rib normal cut, to an even thicker one, and one that is a few really thin slices. Don't get the really thin one, I got that the first time I came here and hated this place... Recently I got the normal House of Prime Rib cut and couldn't be happier. The meal starts with a thing of bread that we pretty much skipped and the tableside salad. I think the salad is ok...people really go ape over it, but it's just a salad, you know? Next came the prime rib with creamed spinach, choice of potato, and some bread thing to soak up the juice. Get the spicy horseradish with the meat, it compliments it well. The creamed spinach is disgustingly tasty - I opted for steamed spinach which was free of everything that is bad for you and also the taste :( The waitress recommended the mashed potatoes, and they are way better than the baked. And I normally prefer baked potatoes...it's just too much work to eat with that giant slab of meat staring back at you. Oh yeah, if you finish your meat, they give you another thin slice. So everyone at my table got the extra slice and ate that too, and they gave us even more spinach and mashed potatoes! After a short angioplasty procedure, I finished my meal and couldn't have been more stuffed. I will never know how the dessert is here...if you have room for it, my hat goes off to you.</review>

	<review>We came in on Friday for my boyfriend's early birthday dinner with Tony L =) We tried to make reservations earlier in the day but they didn't have any openings but informed us that walk-ins are welcomed. We came in at around 7:00PM. We waited in the lounge area, they give you cut little containers of snacks. We didn't get to sit down til almost 8, so I highly recommend you book your reservation ahead of time! Inside the restaurant reminds me of a dungeon/vampire castle =P it's very dim. The menu is very simple- there's about 5 different cuts of prime rib and a fish option for those who don't want prime rib. Each meal comes with salad, baked potato or mashed potato, creams spinach or creamed corn, and yorkshire pudding. They also bring out sour dough for you which is super good =D they also give you some sort of corn bread which tasted pretty bad. I choose the smallest cut- I believe it was the City Cut with mashed potato and creamed spinach. My boyfriend choose the King Henry Cut with baked potato and creamed corn. The salad was pretty tasty, I've never had the dressing before, it was different, not bad. The prime rib- i'm not a huge prime rib person but I thought it was tasty, it melted in your mouth and cooked perfectly. yumm i wasn't able to finish though but my boyfriend was able to finish his. He enjoyed his prime rib and said it was comparable to Lawrys. The sides- i thought wasn't great. the creamed spinach and creamed corn was sort of bland and wasn't creamy enough. the mashed potato tasted like microwavable mashed potato =/ i wish i ordered the baked potato instead. The Yorkshire pudding was a little too salty and I tried not to eat too much because it soaked up the au jus quickly. Service was great! Our waitress was super nice and very attentive. She was kind enough to bring out ice cream for my boyfriend and sang him his birthday song =D Overall, the prime rib and the sour dough bread were great. Sides- don't expect too much =) But do come here and try the prime rib! you won't be disappointed.</review>

	<review>I decided to take Jan out to dinner as a congratulations in getting a new job. So we both decided to try this place out since we heard good reviews about it AND when Tony Bourdain did his episode of No Reservations here in SF, this was one of the places he stopped by. Sooo we thought, let's go here and see what the hype is all about. Although we had reservations, we still had to wait for about 10-15 minutes which wasn't so bad. When we finally got seated, we looked over the menu and I ordered the City Cut w/creamed spinach and yorkshire pudding while Jan ordered the HOPR cut w/the same sides as me. They serve you salad and cornbread while you wait for the "dome cart" to arrive w/your cut. When we get our prime rib, we both were a little disappointed. It was BARELY warm and we like our food hot. Well, makes sense it being not hot since it's just in a warming dome cart. It tasted a tad bland and the sides were actually TASTIER than the prime rib itself?! Like wow, seriously?! I mean the ambience, the service and receiving our food quick was great, but... the star of the place which is in their name and what they're supposed to be known for was disappointing. This place is ok, but we don't really care to go back.</review>

	<review>6 stars! Every year I splurge and gorge myself at the House of Prime Rib for my birthday. I starve myself the entire week in order to prepare myself for the gorging and I go there wearing elastic pants! From the perfectly made Grey Goose martini that I start off with, to the tossed green salad with their amazingly tasty dressing, to a great glass of red vino....everything is superb and the star of the show is the PRIME RIB! I get the huge King Henry VIII cut of rare beautiful beef. It is so tender, you don't really even need a knife to cut through it. It is accompanied by the yorkshire pudding that tastes amazing when it soaks up the au jus from the rib, mashed potatoes, and creamed spinach with little bacon bits...all of it is just fabulous! I also love the warm...sometimes hot crusty french bread and little cornbreads the food server brings. Funny enough, but, I never have room for dessert, so I can't even tell you what is good. I do end my meal with a cappuchino or a cup of coffee and they deliver pretty good stuff! The service is usually pretty good and the waitstaff seems happy working there. It can get pretty loud and crowded because it is such a popular San Francisco establishment. It is much quieter during the week compared to the weekend.</review>

	<review>If you are in a rush, just look at the pictures.  I think they do a great job of conveying what's elaborated and rehashed below.   Does that look gross to you or delicious?  It depends on what you are into / in mood for ... Altogether, the mixed reviews are right on the nose.  Depends when you go and who you go with.  I will quote one of my tablemates, a good salt-of-the-earth-blue-collar-type "This is the kind of place that's best when you go once a year, then it's special and doesn't get old"  Having said that, if you pick a peak time or don't have a reservation, it might not be as much fun as we had. I think some of the issues people have with the host &amp; seating stem from the look-at-me-i'm-middle-class rubes that can flood in there, no social graces whatsoever.  Just prepare yourself and guard your grandma.  I saw a thirty-something square type (not a hoodlum teenager, mind you) shoulder block an octogenarian in a crowded passway.  Nice job.  Manners, people, manners, no one says we actually have to like each other, just be polite in public places!  So yes, they need to manage the front area better, lest it ruin someone's evening entirely and prevent repeat business. But for an "accessible fancy restaurant" at least there were no telltale signs of the bad economy in our meal or service.   My Superpowers: I have the scent detection powers of a bloodhound on steroids.  In a Holmes-ian fashion, I can tell you exactly how the plates were washed, whether the rag to wipe the table was clean, and if they are leaving perishable items out too long.  Often awkward, but useful. The moment I walked in all I could smell was yumminess -- fresh baked bread and sweet cream butter ... and did not encounter one single whiff of anything but delicious food, even when I headed back to the restroom and kitchen area.  That is outstanding in itself, very few restaurants ever hit the 100% mark on that one. We had Miro as a waiter and he was just flirty enough to wow the table but not so much that it ruined my dinner.  We had witty repartee that really did add to the meal experience, especially for my dinner companions who thought he was really in love with me.  But alas I am not the only one - Miro, man, you are so pro! Not a big salad dressing overdoer, was really concerned when they premixed it all for our table.  What a pleasant surprise, the thousand island totally worked with the beets and iceberg. Who knew? I had the City Cut (petite), excellent, plus they will bring you as many as three different types of horseradish if you ask. And f.w.w. the creamed spinach, yorkshire pudding, baked potato, ect. were great.  I could never eat that stuff every day but it was a welcome / homey treat and no unpleasant flavors / textures whatsoever, imho. Hey, just for fun, try a lemon vodka extra dirty martini!  Apparently, the shaker / ice left on the table is their patented business method.  As a graduate of bartending school who never worked a day in my life at a bar, I can tell you it "improperly" adds a lot of water to the drink but really, the drink still ended up tasting good.  Hence, you should try the extra olive juice &amp; flavored vodka, which outlasts the ice perfectly.</review>

	<review>this place has a special place in my heart. i haven't been to ruth chris or harris, so i don't have the other steak houses to compare to, but i LOVE HOPR. i been here on several occasions and each time it gets better an better. i'm never disappointed w/ the doneness of my meat. i love how they give me toasty warm bread. crusty on the outside, and soft on the inside. w/ soft butter. its a cute round loaf that you have to break yourself that comes on a wooden plank. i love how the salad is super chilled, your salad fork is super chilled. they spin the bowl around on a bed of ice to keep it cold and pour a fountain of salad dressing. don't eat too much! (i love bread, so i always end up eating too much bread) but theres a crap load of meat, cream of spinach, and bread pudding and potato. but save all your stomach space for the best meat ever. just laced and ribboned w/ fat thats melted inbetween the meat, the meat is succulent, juicy, and filling and cooked to perfection to my request. creme brulee for dessert, was easily split amongst two people. the trifle had too much alcohol for my liking. but the custard and fruit was yummy. can be split for two people. i'm guessing most of the desserts can be shared since they are pretty hearty in portion. decor is old school, wooden walls, old chandeliers, dark polished wooden furniture, dark lighting, and dinner by candle light. service was excellent. cant remember anything significant that went wrong. people usually like going to this place for special occasions for a night out for a hearty gut busting meal. i was satisfied.</review>

	<review>If you're a red-blooded American, you must dine at the House of Prime Rib. Let me begin by saying that if you plan to go on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday- get reservations (unless you dig on waiting for an hour plus to get a table, then by all means go for it). A lot of people feel that their "limited menu" is a negative and proceed to dump on the HoPR due to this fact. To those people I say this- do you go to the House of Siam and ask for a cheeseburger? No, you don't. The House of Prime Rib is just as advertised- Prime Rib. Now stop whining. The food is unparalleled. The bread- warm and crispy on the outside, soft and delectable on the inside. The cornbread is good as well. The salad is fantastic, I'm not even sure what's in it aside from lettuce, beets and perhaps some sort of cheese. Regardless, the salad is legit- I'm not even that big on Thousand Island dressing but what they use is tangy, Thousand Islandly fabulous. Then comes the meal. Nom nom nom. The Prime Rib is always spot-on, the creamed spinach (with little chunks of bacon) is fantastic and the baked potato... wow, that is something in and of itself. Butter, sour cream, chives, swine... mmmmm. If you ask for a little more bacon they'll put the whole dish of it on (at least our server Jason did).  I'm also happy to report that I have made progress and got down with the Yorkshire Pudding last time I went. It's perfect for sopping up all the au jus and getting that last bit of goodness out of your meal. Now if you can finish your first piece of prime rib, you can request a second piece (at no additional charge). Although this is a fantastic gesture, I'd be surprised if you can one put down another one after all of the amazing food you just had. The service here is typically very good, the timing of everything being brought out last time was fantastic. Considering the high demand for this spot they could be complete jerks do nothing but worry about turning over tables, but they don't. It's very refreshing- they do not rush you at all, but are very attentive. (Jason is stud, you're lucky if you get him). On the scale of legitimacy this one gets Son of God, Immaculate Conception status. Do yourself and your taste buds a favor and go.</review>

	<review>Overrated like Lawry's but not as. I'm only giving it four stars instead of  three because I think Lawry's is a sham and wanted to make sure I gave it a better score. Corn Bread- whoever says the corn bread is good is lying. Maybe i went on an off day but it was like eating a yellow bread rock. Salad- better dressing than Lawry's but really, what salad isnt? I feel like this place caters to the tastes of the elderly. Sliced beets? It would be perfect if I didn't have teeth. Creamed corn and spinach- very blah. Again, i'm sure old people would love it. Baked potato- big and delicious Prime Rib- good but not ridiculously good Service- really good, very attentive and courteous. Great manners. Yorkshire pudding- this is the part that really gets me. i don't know if it's because i am under the age of sixty or if it's because i ate a bad batch but yorkshire pudding is foul. i keep reading people who say it's delicious but it's just a crispy pancake that's raw in the middle. All in all, everything is geared towards old people, from the oldschool decor to the lack of flavor in the sides and salads. I still maintain that the only meat place worth going to is Ruth's Chris.</review>

	<review>Now this is what I call a meal! The wait was a little longer than expected but kudos to the bartender who introduced me to Jameson &amp; cranberry. That was awesome! Get the King Henry cut. It's just a few bucks more and a whole lot of meat. Cooked medium, it was pink to perfection, juicy and straight buttery. The creamed spinach was alright but the Yorkshire pudding really set it off. Every Monday night dinner should be this good! I've been told you can ask for seconds but you're not allowed to take it home if you can't finish it, which is strange considering they just throw it out anyway.</review>

	<review>I came here a few years ago for a friend's birthday. I made the mistake of ordering the largest cut of meat RARE.  It was pretty gruesome.  I couldn't eat it.  My dogs had a fine meal after my visit to HOPR.</review>

	<review>Still my favorite prime rib restaurant. I took my friend for the first time and he loved it. If you finish your prime rib then they give you a second cut. THIN but still very nice that they do that. I never finish my first to get to the complimentary second cut. I noticed that the other parking lots had signs that read $5 to park it yourself right across the street from HOPR. That is cheaper than paying valet $8. Usually they charge $30 but maybe since the economy is bad they lowered the price. I was wearing 5 inch heels so I opted for the valet because I didn't want to walk across the street on uneven terrain in my sexy heels.</review>

	<review>HOPR has been around for ages, and the interior most certainly reflects that. Despite the need for a makeover, they still are able to cram a full house of diners with reservations every night. They will not seat you until your entire party is there. Once seated, the marathon begins with the server to order drinks, dinner, serve food, offer dessert and then get you out so someone else can take your place. Either that or they  seem to be understaffed. This hardly matters, because people continuously come back for the food. There's barely a price difference between all the prime rib options. Meals are served with the AMAZING salad, choice of baked/mashed potato, choice of creamed spinach/corn, and yorkshire pudding. After devouring the prime rib, they offer seconds (a small sliver). Reservations and street parking are extremely difficult to come by.</review>

	<review>There's really nothing to complain about this place except maybe trying to find parking around the area.  They do have valet parking if you're willing to pay for it. The surroundings and atmosphere are great here, and the service always pleasant.  I really think if you come here and order anything besides prime rib (unless you're vegetarian in a party), then you're wasting your money.  Like the name of the restaurant says, it's Prime Rib and that should be the only thing your stomach craves once you step in the door. I've never had bad prime rib here.  It's consistently served at a perfect temperature and the proper doneness.  I think what's great about this place is the experience.  I'm always a sucker for restaurants that do something different for service.  In this case, they roll out a rotisserie oven with a slab of glorious cow seasoned and cooked to perfection, ready to be sliced for all the hungry mouths at the table.  In addition to that they bring all the fixings out and give it to you til you say stop. if you order the King platter, they will usually offer you a second slice (granted a thin slice) if you're still hungry or want to stuff yourself to the max.    This is of course after the side salad or soup, along with the cornbread that should have the Lay's title of "bet you can't eat just one" imprinted on it, and the thoughts of dessert afterwards. A staple in SF and a must visit for any meat lover.   (and I give it a four, cuz I still think my prime rib is better :P).</review>

	<review>Been a while since the wife and I had been here. VERY glad we came back!!! I don't usually like beets or egg in salad but it was excellently done and very tasty. The dressing was a red wine vinaigrette and definitely yummy. Had the King Henry VIII cut and it was done absofunginglute perfection! If you finish the King cut and want an extra piece for seconds, it is smaller and you have to eat it there, but the 2nd piece was even better than the first. The meat was juicy and delicious. Creamed Spinach, Mash and Yorkshire pudding with it is a recipe for being completely stuffed. We got home, put the baby to bed and had to take a nap we were so full! Mmmm...food coma. The staff was great and very nice. It's always a nice, old world touch when the owner of the restaurant comes out to greet you and talks to the diners at EVERY table. Love this place.</review>

	<review>After a nice ride with the boys and craving meat HOPR came to mind.  So making our way up Van Ness we come upon the HOPR. It's been a while since we went to this establisment as we enter we are greeted by the host he looks at us and the first thing he says is where the hell have you been?  It's nice to be remembered so he seats us and our waiter smiles and says haven't seen you in a while. We don't even look at the menu and he says you want the usual and laughs. We always order the King Henry cut .  The salad being tossed at the table is a trip and it's always fresh and we had baskets of bread with it. The Prime rib is always tender and all the great sides that come with it makes it worth coming here.  As we get ready to roll with our left overs  the waiter takes care of us if you know what i mean! The boxes were filled with more than we had. In reality it was another dinner in a box so we scored again dinner for 2 more days.  lol   The service is always great and the old timers remember you if your a regular. I won't wait as long as i did to return I think I got a few peeps i got to take care of for their special day.  If your heading to the city and crave some meat you got to hit this place up.</review>

	<review>House of Prime Rib gets 5 stars because you get exactly what you pay for.  They're not selling globally-inspired high-end fusion cuisine served in designer small plates hand-crafted by French artisans.  They are selling you gigantic slabs of juicy American prime rib.  With potatoes.  And bread.  And salad with egg in it.  But they do it very well.  You won't be able to find another restaurant in SF that will serve what they serve at their price point.  The decor is kind of cute in a kitschy sort of way.  Parking sucks in that area.  The service is always decent.  The prime rib is super juicy and tender.   What you get with your cut: They offer a selection of horseradish for you to choose from, a well-seasoned salad tossed right at your table (a little salty for my taste, but still a decent salad that's loaded with extras), potatoes of your liking, mini loaves of sourdough bread, creamed spinach, and some sort of eggy pudding bread concoction that I never eat.  You can't be crazy grubbin on the sides what with the second serving of prime rib you have to eat. Reservations are important and vital if your ass doesn't want to wait around nibbling tiny rice crackers for an hour. The English Cut is my favorite, but the City Cut's not bad either.  I just think that with the really big cuts you spend more of your energy chewing the meat than savoring the flavor.   Did you know this place gives you SECONDS if you can finish your first serving of prime rib?  That's right, more meat that you can manage.  Yes, yes, I've had better prime rib once or twice before, but they charged me more and I certainly did not have enough left over to take home and make into a midnight steak sandwiche.  Or second dinner or whatever.</review>

	<review>This place is a more low-key version of Lawry's in Beverly Hills. "House of Prime Rib" is always on one of my places to stop by when I'm in the Bay area. The menu selection is simple.  Yet good.  Asides from the prime rib, enjoy all the sides that they with the meat: creamed  corn, creamed spinach, yorkshire pudding, salad, yummmmmy!  They bring the carving station over to you and slice the prime rib  right in front of you. The food and service is consistently good. I have never been disappointed here.  Make sure you call for reservations though.  It gets busy!!!</review>

	<review>HOPR for prime rib on the 7x7 Big Eat SF List. I'm not much of a fan of prime rib, so I may be a little biased. We had a party of 10 and our whole group had to arrive in order to be seated, so we hung around at the bar and munched on mixed rice cracker snacks that they provided. Very spacious with plenty of seats all around and multiple dining areas. The atmosphere was nice and warm with dim lighting and warm colors. The menu is really simple: Choose a cut for your prime rib along with your two sides and dinner is served... - Sour Dough Bread: warm, but typical and nothing special. - Corn Bread: It came in a shape of a cob of corn, so cute. I wish they provided sweet butter  to accompany this. - The City Cut: The smallest cut that they served and it was still a lot of food if you count all the sides that it came with. If you choose any other cut, you can get a 2nd thinner slice on the house after you finish your first slice. FYI, you can't take your 2nd slice To Go though. I have to say that their prime rib was really tender and good. - The Salad Bowl: it looked interesting when the waiter spun this salad around and mixed in the dressing. A little too much on the dressing and they used iceburg lettuce, which made the salad lack in quality. It was interesting that they included shredded beets, not bad. - Mashed potatoes: Flavored well and smooth, you can't go wrong with this dish. - Yorkshire Pudding: similar to a crepe/pancake, not sweet and flavorless, I would rather have it with something sweet as a dessert. I could do without it. - Creamed Spinach: Tried some of this from the BF. Rich and creamy, but nothing spectacular. - Creamed Corn: Wasn't listed on the menu, but the waiter mentioned it when I inquired and it was alright. Creamy and rich like the creamed spinach. I was stuffed to the max after attempting to finish everything, which I failed even with the smallest cut. It was A LOT of food and I am happy to say I finally tried HOPR and knocked off another one off my 7x7 list of places to try. Service was wonderful and the staff was very accommodating. It was a sight watching the blimp like cart rolling around, while the chef masterfully cut the prime rib. P.S. Parking may be difficult, but they have Valet.</review>
